Richard Stallman is the founder of the GNU Project, launched in 1984 to develop the free software operating system GNU. The name ``GNU'' is a recursive acronym for ``GNU's Not Unix''. GNU is free software: everyone is free to copy it and redistribute it, as well as to make changes either large or small. Non-free software keeps users divided and helpless, forbidden to share it and unable to change it. A free operating system is essential for people to be able to use computers in freedom. Today, Linux-based variants of the GNU system, based on the kernel Linux developed by Linus Torvalds, are in widespread use. There are estimated to be some 20 million users of GNU/Linux systems today. Richard Stallman is the principal author of the GNU Compiler Collection, a portable optimizing compiler which was designed to support diverse architectures and multiple languages. The compiler now supports over 30 different architectures and 7 programming languages. Stallman also wrote the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and various other programs for the GNU operating system. Stallman graduated from Harvard in 1974 with a BA in physics. During his college years, he also worked as a staff hacker at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, learning operating system development by doing it. He wrote the first extensible Emacs text editor there in 1975. He also developed the AI technique of dependency-directed backtracking, also known as truth maintenance. In January 1984 he resigned from MIT to start the GNU project. Stallman received the Grace Hopper award for 1991 from the Association for Computing Machinery, for his development of the first Emacs editor. In 1990 he was awarded a Macarthur foundation fellowship, and in 1996 an honorary doctorate from the royal institute of Technology in Sweden. In 1998 he received the Electronic Frontier Foundation's pioneer award along with Linus Torvalds. In 1999 he received the Yuri Rubinski award. In 2001 he received a second honorary doctorate, from the University of Glasgow, and shared the Takeda award for social/economic betterment with Torvalds and Ken Sakamura. In 2002 he was elected to the US National Academy of Engineering, and in 2003 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2003 he was named an honorary professor of the Universided Nacional de Ingenieria in Peru, and received an honorary doctorate from the Free University of Brussels.

Father of Spring Framework ( Interface21 ) Rod is the father of Spring. The Spring Framework open source project began in February 2003, based on the Interface21 framework published with Rod's best-selling Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development. Rod is one of the world's leading authorities on Java and J2EE development. He is a best-selling author, experienced consultant, and open source developer, as well as a popular conference speaker. Rod's best-selling Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development (2002) was one of the most influential books ever published on J2EE. The sequel, J2EE without EJB (July 2004, with Juergen Hoeller), has proven almost equally significant, establishing a comprehensive vision for lightweight, post-EJB J2EE development. Rod has extensive experience as a consultant in a wide range of industries: principally, finance, media and insurance. He has specialized in server-side Java development since 1996. Prior to that, he worked mainly in C and C++. His experience as a consultant has led him to see problems from a client's perspective as well as a technology perspective, and has driven his influential criticism of bloated, inefficient, orthodox approaches to J2EE architecture, which have delivered very poor results for stakeholders. Rod is the founder of the Spring Framework, which began from code published with Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development. Along with Juergen Hoeller, he continues to lead the development of Spring. He regularly speaks at conferences in the US, Europe and Asia, including the ServerSide Symposium (2003, 2004 and 2005), JavaPolis (Europe's leading Java conference), and JAOO (2004). Engagements in 2005 include two presentations at JavaOne 2005 and a keynote at the JavaWorld 2005 conference (Tokyo, June). Rod serves in the JCP on the Expert Groups defining the Servlet 2.4 and JDO 2.0 specifications. Rod continues to be actively involved in client projects at Interface21, as well as Spring development, writing and evangelism.

Her book Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit was awarded the Software Development Productivity Award in 2004. Abstract Beyond Agile Software Development: Becoming Lean Lean thinking has had a dramatic effect on industries from manufacturing to banking to hospitals. In software development, lean principles lead us inevitably to agile software development – and beyond. Lean is not just about iterative development, it is about transforming customer needs into deployed software rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly. Lean is not about slowing down and being careful, it’s about catching errors the moment they occur so that you can reliably go fast. And finally, lean is about taking a look at the amount of work you have piled up in lists and queues – with an eye to getting rid of the queues entirely. This presentation deals with aspects of lean that you might not have thought about while implementing agile software development practices. It will challenge development teams to think differently about the way they approach their work. Level The talk will be appropriate for any level. Outline Principles of Lean Just-in-Time – What does this mean in software development? Stop-the-Line – How does this actually work? Whole Team, Complete Product What is a value stream? What is a team? Go Fast Why Quality, Speed, and Low Cost go together How Queuing Theory works in software development.

He developed his own version of Software Inspection (about 400 process changes compared to Fagan's version) and documented this (with co-author Dorothy Graham) in the worlds first published book on Inspection (Software Inspection 1993, now in 14th printing). The book also includes 2 chapters on the Defect Prevention Process (aka CMMI Level 5) and many guest chapter case studies.

I'm a Java EE developer since 2005, working with IBM Austria, IBA CZ, and now Iterate Norway. I've worked on many different projects, often in enterprise environments with complex deployment structures and strict security, legal and other rules, serving hundreds of thousands of users. I've learned about code injection years ago when I started to work on extending, customizing, and maintaining a large, third-party, closed-source J2EE enterprise application. During the years I've found code injection to be indispensable for troubleshooting and for dealing with cross-cutting concerns like performance monitoring in an elegant way, both on this J2EE project and many others. My primary interests are code quality, application performance, and ease of development, including the golden rule Don't Repeat Yourself - one of the reasons why I appreciate code injection. I share my technical endeavors and experience reports at my blog http://theholyjava.wordpress.com/ and you can also find some of the articles at DZone.

I am one of those guys who just loves playing with technology, if I can automate something using a computer, give someone a better user experience, play with something new or if someone tells me something just can’t be done I have to get stuck straight in. Up until a year ago I lived in Ireland where I was born, raised, went to school, went to University (when I woke up on time) and worked as much as I possibly could from the day I was legally allowed to. I come from quite a different background than most. I started out as a developer in a Coal Fired power station in Ireland where I wrote ladder logic for PLC’s that controlled different parts of the power station and then wrote software that operators could use to control the power station. I moved on to a company called Liberty IT who are responsible for writing all the software for the American insurance giant Liberty Mutual. I wrote in house and external web app’s for Liberty, some of which had to be written to incorporate with existing systems that were written in Java and still using Struts version 1.0 and some were brand new systems that we were allowed to use much more modern technology. Seeking new challenges I followed my Norwegian Girlfriend to Norway and I now work in Statkraft as a developer writing software for the energy management department. I am also a keen motorbike racer that loves being able to incorporate my software knowledge into my mechanical knowledge when building new race bikes each year for the upcoming season. I have written my own data logging software and my own quick shifter using the popular micro-controller known as an Arduino. I talked at Smidig 2012 about motivating teams and I hope you join me to here about the more technical side of my job
