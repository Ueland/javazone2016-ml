Rule engines in java programming, why and how.
There is a trend in building smarter and smarter software, where the aim of the software is to represent knowledge of some specific application area. Knowledge can be defined as "productive use of information", and can be represented on the form "IF (list of condtitons) THEN do list of actions". The reasons why knowledge is important includes supporting users to perform better choices, such as the book recomendations at Amazon, automate business processes and to build more flexible and adaptive software. The most common tools used to support knowledge representation is the rule engine. The key problem to resolve within a rule engine is execution time. This has been addressed and resolved by the RETE algorithm, where there exist powerfull implementations such as JRULES from ILOG and JESS, products that implements the interfaces defined in JSR-94, the Java standard for rule engine interfaces. During this lecture the issues adressed above will be presented and examples at code level will be presented.

So you think you know Java? This talk will help you answer that question. Statistics show that real-life experience in Java programming alone is not sufficient for passing the certification exam. The exam requires in depth knowledge of features and usage of the Java programming language. The talk provides a roadmap for achieving the right level of proficiency demanded by the certification exam.
So you think you know Java? This talk will help you answer that question. Statistics show that real-life experience in Java programming alone is not sufficient for passing the certification exam. The exam requires in depth knowledge of features and usage of the Java programming language. The talk provides a roadmap for achieving the right level of proficiency demanded by the certification exam. First we answer some questions about Java certification: What is certification. Why get certified. Who should get certified. How to get certified. How to plan, study and prepare for certification. Where to get certification resources. The main part of the talk will concentrate on giving examples which provide insights into some of the topics that appear on the exam: Shift operators equals(), hashCode() and compareTo() methods Intern strings Upcasting and downcasting Exception scenarios with try-catch-finally Overriding and overloading Nested classes Thread communication Audience participation will be solicited.

A discussion of the MVC pattern
MVC was conceived in 1978 as the design solution to a particular problem. The top level goal was to support the user's mental model of the relevant information space and to enable the user to inspect and edit this information. The first part of the talk describes the original problem and discusses the chosen solution. The second part elaborates the original ideas and extends the scope to include current day challenges to the original goal. We examine some ideas related to MVC that are found in the literature and select those that appear to be particularly relevant to the top level goal. The third and final part summarizes it all in a condensed and coherent MVC pattern language.

- Thirteen Recommendations for Refactoring, Repairing and Regaining Control of Your Code This session outlines a concrete thirteen-point list of practices (zero through twelve) that can be applied out-of-the-box to reduce code size and complexity, acting as both guidelines for new code and indicators for refactoring.
There is no shortage of technical wisdom on how to develop clear and robust code, so why the confused expression on many a programmer's face when staring at all those source files, trying to make sense of the encrypted code? There are companies whose development culture does not encourage pursuit of knowledge of practice: a penny-wise pound-foolish approach. However, there are many companies and developers that want to push themselves to the state of the art, but seem swamped and bemused by how much state there really is to that art. This session outlines a concrete thirteen-point list of practices (zero through twelve) that can be applied out-of-the-box to reduce code size and complexity, acting as both guidelines for new code and indicators for refactoring. The short list has no ambition to be all that you needed to know about design but were afraid to ask, but it does offer an easily memorable and easily practised set of guidelines that offer the greatest immediate return on investment - the most bang for your buck, oomph for your euro or kerrang for your kroner.

How to build a first-cut application using an MDA-based tool and how to modify it where necessary, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of coding rather than the tedious, repetitive tasks.
The past has thought us that, in large projects with many developers, the model and the application drift apart and a point arrives when a reverse engineering exercise is tried. This often results in a model that is unintelligible, badly commented and laid out. So we now have a pretty model that doesn't reflect the code or a messy one that is true but unusable. Typically the analysts continue to work with their tidy model and the developers stick with the 'code view'. MDA-based tools unite model and code so that they can't drift apart. This presentation/demonstration will explain the MDA concepts, how OptimalJ maps to MDA and OptimalJ's implementation of MDA, which focuses on models and patterns. You will see how to build a first-cut application using an MDA-based tool and how to modify it where necessary, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of coding rather than the tedious, repetitive tasks.

This session tries to unscramble the architecture and acronym soup and clearly explains the differences and details of the standards and how they fit together.
With the broad adoption of Web services we find an explosion in standards activity that can confuse the most adept amongst us as we follow and decode the activities and products that support them. Core Web services built on a basic stack of SOAP, WSDL, UDDI and XML to provide Messaging, Discovery and Description services are generally accepted and understood within the community. But the architecture and standards layers don’t stop there. New and emerging standards build the necessary layers of architecture support for the Plug and Play Business embracing : Security ( with Liberty, XACML and SAML ), Reliable Messaging (with WS-RM), Transactions, Coordination and Choreography (with BPEL4WS, WSCI) with an end game of business process standardisation through ebXML and RosettaNet and compute resource on demand from Grid services through the GLOBUS alliance. This session tries to unscramble the architecture and acronym soup and clearly explains the differences and details of the standards and how they fit together into an SOA approach for software development and organisational collaboration and maps these standards into a forward vision for the Oracle technology stack.

how to make an enterprise architecture around the oo model.
Object models are the best known tool to handle complexity and change. Yet main-stream enterprise arkitectures downplay the role of the oo model at best. The session will show very concretely how to make an architecture around the oo model which addresses the requirements of enterprise applications better than the main-stream non-oo enterprise architectures.

When dealing with distributed enterprise applications, designing functionality in terms of services can promote flexibility, and result in easy to use APIs across application domains. Lower coupling and improved cross-application reusability can also be achieved when clearly separating services and data. Business logic in large-scale systems should be defined in terms of java interfaces and implemented in terms of distributed stateless services. By then encapsulating service invocation using java 1.3 Dynamic Proxies, we can both get a high degree of flexibility and have simple to use client APIs as a result.
When designing enterprise applications, being able to create understandable API's is important. The same API's should also easily lend themself to distribution in form of J2EE SLSB's or Web Services, providing a centralized repository of services accessible from multiple platforms, channels and applications. When using services in a distributed environments, effort and focus tend to shifts from using business related functionality, to create Service locators, discuss home vs remote interfaces or web services, i.e. to discuss infrastructure. By defining some simple naming conventions for java classes and by the application of java 1.3 Dynamic Proxies; java idioms and simple framework from creating and using services in a distributed environment can be established. Everything related to infrastructure can be isolated in a few classes and hidden from the user, and code-generation can be kept to a minimum. The author has created a simple framework for accessing distributed services that: Uses a java interface for each service Uses a generic factory for getting an instance implementing the service Creates a chain of InvocationHandlers that can intercept method calls of the service Can dynamically add restricted time execution, and asynchroumos execution of the service

Bouvet was selected to build a new real time information feed for the nordic power exchange NordPool. Jini technology combined with the Creare RBNB was selected as the platform. The presentation will take a tour through the key demands, the chosen architecture down to code level.
Bouvet was selected to build a new real time information feed for the nordic power exchange NordPool, where the feed system is used to feed information syndicates with market information in real time. The nature of the system is best illustrated by some key requirements: Maximum delay of mesages 1,5 second from a trade has taken place and the information is delivered to customers Handle 100 messages / second in peak sequences of 3 seconds Required availability during opening hours 99.15% pr. 15 minute To meet the functional and non functional requirements a resilient and redundant design was required, and during analysis it became more and more clear that use of Jini technology combined with the Creare RBNB data turbine constituded the most cost efficient platform that met the requirements. With respect to Jini the Rio software was used, as it provided a higher abstraction level for developers and provided the key mekanisms for building an adaptable system. The presentation will take a tour through the key demands, the chosen architecture down to code level.

Discussion of the problems a developer faces when it comes to differentiating specs on various terminals on the market today, with references to real life models. There will also be focus on the various extensions existing in both Asia and the Western countries, and how to utilize these without breaking platform independence.
Discussion of the problems a developer faces when it comes to differentiating specs on various terminals on the market today, with references to real life models. The problems varies from the obvious like different screen sizes, language, CPU speed and input options to unofficial extensions you are "forced" to use and bugs in the Java implementation. There will also be focus on the various extensions existing in both Asia and the Western countries, and how to utilize these without breaking platform independence. This leads to the need for a complex versioning system, as many builds might result from each game, this will also be discussed. The presentation will also have a business angle, giving some views on the market today, locally, in Asia with some visions for the future.

An object is an object is an object, right? So you need objects for the big things in your system, and you can do the rest with integers and other primitives. This talk presents a set of patterns, connected into a pattern language, for defining value objects in Java.
An object is an object is an object, right? So you need objects for the big things in your system, and you can do the rest with integers and other primitives. Although this can be -- and is -- made to work, it is not make the best use of object orientation. Unfortunately it is the approach taken by many development methods and APIs. There are many different categories of object that can be used to express quite different concepts in a system. And yet many programming guidelines seek to have "one true way" of defining a class, what should go into its interface, what methods to provide, how to define them, etc. Perhaps the most commonly overlooked category is that of value objects, objects that represent fine-grained informational concepts in your system. Defining value objects is not simply about defining a "big object" class and leaving a few things out, the practices are quite different. This talk presents a set of patterns, connected into a pattern language, for defining value objects in Java. The talk includes coverage of the common pitfalls or oversights in both interface and representation design, and aims to present a reasoned, pragmatic and sparing approach to the use of Java's language features in expressing value concepts.

Java Generics (JG) has been the most sought-after feature by Java developers. It is now finally added to Java 1.5. JG provides extra type information at compile time to avoid verbosity and the need for explicit type checking and casting at runtime. It is implemented as compiler transformations, with insignificant impact on the JVM for backward compatibility. Through examples, this tutorial explains usage and declaration of generic types and methods. It also covers what impact JG has and how it relates to other features of the language. JG is touted to have a profound affect on how Java programs will be developed. To understand the underpinnings and limitations of JG, the tutorial also covers the following topics: Type Parameter Bounds, Wildcards, Generic Methods, Raw Types, and Type Erasure.

J2EE developers can lose a lot of time writing code to implement best-practices design patterns to achieve well-architected applications. JSR 227 eliminates some of this routine coding by standardizing a declarative approach to data binding. This presentation illustrates Oracle's runtime and designtime implementation of JSR 227 in its Oracle Application Development Framework (ADF), and highlights the facilities that Oracle ADF provides for productively building and data-binding to J2EE business services. Along the way, we showcase the best-practice techniques that Oracle's over-2000 internal J2EE application developers have made and motivate why.

JSR 227 eliminates some of this routine coding by standardizing a declarative approach to data binding. This presentation illustrates Oracle's runtime and designtime implementation of JSR 227 in its Oracle Application Development Framework (ADF), and highlights the facilities that Oracle ADF provides for productively building and data-binding to J2EE business services. Along the way, we showcase the best-practice techniques that Oracle's over-2000 internal J2EE application developers have made and motivate why.

Qualitative requirements can and should always be specified as clearly as possible. Most people do not know how. Everybody can learn how.
Artikkel: Quantifying Quality Qualitative requirements can and should always be specified as clearly as possible. Most people do not know how. Everybody can learn how. Organizations should insist on quantitative clarity for all critical qualitative aspects of their project, process or product. The main concept is to define an "operational scale of measure" for all qualitative requirements. You can quantify any quality. This quantification ability will give you control over quality and over related quality costs. It will improve your personal, and corporate, ability to manage projects, products, services, local quality of life where you live or work,[TG1] and organizational improvement. It is a useful general skill for top managers, technical directors, product managers, project managers, social services, idealists, and engineers. This book will focus on the practical ‘how to quantify’. Then if you want to see some of the practical consequences of this ability – we will teach you some related methods. Examples: Instead of ‘very user friendly’ - We could specify ’10 minutes to learn to do something’ Instead of ‘highly secure’ - We could specify ’99.9% of all intentional attacks will be detected and 99% thwarted’ Instead of ‘very adaptable’ - We could specify ‘employee gets back to normal productivity within one week of new environment’ "Use figures as little as you can", said the grand old man of American accounting James Anyon, who came from Lancashire. "Remember your client doesn’t like or want them, he wants brains. Think and act upon facts, truths and principles and regard figures only as things to express these, and so proceeding your are likely to become a great accountant and a credit to one of the truest and finest professions in the land."[Boyle00, p.38]

Assertion facilities as found in Java 1.4 are known to be very useful as they increase the probability of detecting the presence of bugs. Design by Contract1 (DbC) allows for more powerful assertions.
Abstract Design by Contract1 (DbC) allows for more powerful assertions since with the DbC framework assertions take the form of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants. Preconditions specify something that must be true before a specific method executes, postconditions specify something that must be true after a specific method executes, and class invariants state something that must be true within a context of a specific class before and after any public method belonging to class executes. For example, in a Person class we may want to specify the invariant that the age attribute is never negative. If this is ever broken we ask the system to let us know by, for example, throwing an unchecked exception. Developing software with such a framework allows for developers to build better software by organizing the communication between software elements through specifying, the mutual obligations and benefits that are involved in those communications, where the specifications are the contracts. The benefit of DbC is said to be better designed software with improved reliability where the documentation is better, the debugging is easier, and support for reuse is better. The DbC concept is taken further in UML via OCL as contracts are expressed in higher-order logic and the contracts can be specified during analysis. Outline Introduction to Design by Contract (DbC) and the principles & guidelines to writing good contracts. (10 min) Introduction to DbC in UML with OCL. (5 min) Introduction to ocl2j, a prototypical tool that converts OCL contracts into Java assertions and instruments these into the target program using aspect-oriented programming. (10 min) Discussion of recent advances and findings in the field, i.e., guidelines how to best use the technology derived from empirical studies. (5 min) Examples pertinent to core and enterprise software development. The examples will show how this approach can solve real problems that developers have to contend with, i.e., control over the use of inheritance (distinguishing between subclassing and subtyping) and unambiguous specifications. (15 to 20 min) Required experience Basic experience with Java and UML class diagrams. Expected audience Software professionals interested in developing software of higher quality faster, specifically, software with a better design, better reliability, easier reuse, and easier debugging.

In this session we will show how Maven can be used on real-life projects to handle continuous integration, project intra-dependencies, artifact templates, and source code structure.
When the project size and complexity grows, the effort needed to maintain source code and project builds increase. In order to minimize this effort, and being able to focus on the problem domain, a well-functioning build environment is essential. Maven is an open source project management and build tool that aims to address such challenges by providing a well-defined project structure, and a coherent body of documentation that keeps the project team apprised of project status. By using Maven we are able to ease the project build and source code management effort, lowering the start-up-time for new developers, perform easier reporting, while introducing a framework that facilitates agile methodologies. We will dive into the details on how Maven is configured, and address some of the challenges, and best practices that we have found. Introduction Problem focus: hard to manage builds and dependencies in larger J2EE projects Strategies for solving this problem: using Maven. Maven history. Maven key aspects Keywords: Project Object Model, configuration using properties, local and remote repositories, site generation Will go through key concepts while show running Maven to perform a build. Project challenges Keywords: challenges using Ant: large scripts, maintenance of scripts, no re-use. Managing inter-project dependencies, builds. Maven benefits Keywords: example of project structure, script re-usability, continuous integration with Maven, creating reusable project templates using plugins, reporting Will show generated site documentation for entire project.

WesternGeco has been running an internal proof of concept project using OptimalJ this spring and summer. This report summarizes the experiences with the current state of art in MDA. Do we get reduced development time and improved quality?
UML based modeling tools have been around for a few years now. These tools have helped people creating visual models to improve the understanding of both the problem and solution domain. These models have been very useful at particular phases of development, but because of the lack of traceability and consistency between the various models and tools, the models themselves and in particular the code get fairly quickly out of sync. Model driven engineering (MDA) defined by OMG is a new approach that tries to close this gap and keep models and code in sync by advanced code-generation. It also removes the tedious work coding towards various middleware. Very few systems today are developed completely from scratch. Most systems are modifications or reengineering of existing systems. If would be a tremendous improvement in both quality and effort if the reengineering task could start from existing up-to-date models of the existing system. The lifetime of most software systems tends to be quite long. During this time the systems undergo quite significant changes. The initial development is often less than 20% of the total effort. If the models could stay up-to-date and synchronized with the code this would significantly reduce the effort of sustaining and supporting systems. WesternGeco has a big internal software development organization that has been involved in several EU-projects that focus on MDA. We have been running an internal proof of concept project using OptimalJ this spring and summer. This report summarizes the experiences with the current state of art in MDA. Do we get reduced development time and improved quality?

Everyone is talking about Model Driven Development (MDD) BUT why do we need it? Is it the answer to IT productivity? The core problem of software development is to balance increased productivity with flexibility and control.
Everyone is talking about Model Driven Development (MDD) BUT why do we need it? Is it the answer to IT productivity? The core problem of software development is to balance increased productivity with flexibility and control. This presentation will look beyond MDD and will reveal an approach that allows you to develop applications faster, while leveraging your expertise and leaving you in control. Goal MDD is enjoying high visibility but this presentation will look beyond MDD and will reveal an approach that allows you to develop applications faster, while leveraging your expertise and leaving you in control. This presentation will outline the essence of Model Driven Architecture (MDA) - the reality not the hype. It is no exaggeration to say that MDA has the potential to revolutionise the way we create and maintain software. Since MDA is becoming so popular, it is important to understand clearly why we need it, what it is - and what it is not. The goal of this presentation is to answer these questions. The Essence of MDA What is it about MDA that offers such drastic improvements over conventional methods of software development? The answer to this question lies in its "separation of concerns". MDA divides domain knowledge and platform knowledge allowing domain experts, platform experts and application developers to contribute their respective knowledge independently. Increase Productivity and Control Over the years the level of abstraction has risen, allowing programmers to create more and more powerful applications in return for a given investment of time and effort. The drawback was that they sacrificed other desirable factors, such as flexibility and standardisation, for this productivity. That is why, 15 years after 4GLs looked set to replace 3GLs, most of today's programming is done in 3GLs like C, C++ and Java. MDA strikes a compromise between power, flexibility and standardisation. It allows development to move smoothly between levels of abstraction, with much of the tedious, plumbing work being automated. What MDA is NOT The essence of MDA requires the separation of domain and platform expertise, which numerous approaches don't allow. The presentation will make heavy use of pictures, examples and demonstrations. Required experience: Java, development and/or application architecture and design knowledge expected. Expected Audience: Who should attend? Developers of all levels and architects. How will participants benefit? They will get a clear understanding on MDD, in particular MDA.

Richard Stallman will speak about the goals and philosophy of the Free Software Movement, and how they impact the use and development of Java.
Richard Stallman will speak about the goals and philosophy of the Free Software Movement, and how they impact the use and development of Java.
Richard Stallman is the founder of the GNU Project, launched in 1984 to develop the free software operating system GNU. The name ``GNU'' is a recursive acronym for ``GNU's Not Unix''. GNU is free software: everyone is free to copy it and redistribute it, as well as to make changes either large or small. Non-free software keeps users divided and helpless, forbidden to share it and unable to change it. A free operating system is essential for people to be able to use computers in freedom. Today, Linux-based variants of the GNU system, based on the kernel Linux developed by Linus Torvalds, are in widespread use. There are estimated to be some 20 million users of GNU/Linux systems today. Richard Stallman is the principal author of the GNU Compiler Collection, a portable optimizing compiler which was designed to support diverse architectures and multiple languages. The compiler now supports over 30 different architectures and 7 programming languages. Stallman also wrote the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and various other programs for the GNU operating system. Stallman graduated from Harvard in 1974 with a BA in physics. During his college years, he also worked as a staff hacker at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, learning operating system development by doing it. He wrote the first extensible Emacs text editor there in 1975. He also developed the AI technique of dependency-directed backtracking, also known as truth maintenance. In January 1984 he resigned from MIT to start the GNU project. Stallman received the Grace Hopper award for 1991 from the Association for Computing Machinery, for his development of the first Emacs editor. In 1990 he was awarded a Macarthur foundation fellowship, and in 1996 an honorary doctorate from the royal institute of Technology in Sweden. In 1998 he received the Electronic Frontier Foundation's pioneer award along with Linus Torvalds. In 1999 he received the Yuri Rubinski award. In 2001 he received a second honorary doctorate, from the University of Glasgow, and shared the Takeda award for social/economic betterment with Torvalds and Ken Sakamura. In 2002 he was elected to the US National Academy of Engineering, and in 2003 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2003 he was named an honorary professor of the Universided Nacional de Ingenieria in Peru, and received an honorary doctorate from the Free University of Brussels.

Portlets are subject to become the new hype of web programming and the JSR 168 / WSRP has made this hype become realistic. The portlet programming model requires a new way of thinking compared to standard web application development.
The current Portlet API works well for the "hello world" and stock-ticker applications, but not for enterprise applications, where page-flow, web-components, and input validation, become time consuming and important. The application is no longer alone at the clients browser, and there is a new API to conform to. None of the high-level web development frameworks cannot fully be utilized, making them unattractive choices for doing enterprise development of portlets. This presentation is divided into three sections: 1) An overview of portlets/JSR 168 and the challenges with this programming model. 2) Show how Struts can be customized to be compatible with the JSR 168, allowing the developer to use all Struts' bells and whistles the same way as before. This approach would also make it easy to port existing Struts applications to conform to JSR 168. 3) A brief overview of what impact the JSR 168 portlets and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) may have on future web development.
( Objectware AS ) MSIS, University of Pittsburgh Ole Andre Ranvik is a senior consultant working for Objectware AS. He has specialized in J2EE web development and is a Sun certified web component developer. He is an early adopter of several web-centric technologies, such as Struts MVC framework and JSR 168 portlet specification.

This session gives an overview of the JSR 168 portlet programming model, and how to utilize it to write portlets that can run on any JSR 168 compliant portlet container.
This session presents the Java Portlet Specification (JSR 168) and gives an outlook of its implementation in IBM WebSphere Portal. JSR 168 provides a standard for Java-based web applications that are not self-contained but run in a presentation and management environment that is provided by a J2EE portal. The presentation shows the goals (and non-goals) of JSR 168 and explains the interaction of portlets and the portlet container. It introduces the programming concepts of the specification, contrasting them with the well-known servlet concepts, and gives some programming examples for portlets. Finally, the specific capabilities of the JSR 168 implementation in IBM WebSphere Portal are presented and it is shown how portlet programmers can make optimal use of WebSphere Portal features while writing standard compliant portlets that run on any JSR 168 implementation. Required experience: J2EE concepts, Servlet programming experience Expected audience: J2EE architects and programmers that are interested in new standards for writing modular web applications. Pariticipants will learn about a standards-based programming model that allows to make use of the presentation and management framework provided by a J2EE portal and about IBM middleware support for this standard.

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an organizational and design methodology that maximizes the reuse of application-neutral services. Process-driven development has become acknowledged as a much more intuitive and powerful way to develop composite applications. This session will show how to model and execute business processes that span multiple systems, services, and users using process-centric constructs like sequencing, branching, system state, and causality.
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an organizational and design methodology that maximizes the reuse of application-neutral services. The benefits include greater reuse of IT assets, faster delivery of value to the business, and greater adaptability to support ongoing change. While Integrated Service Environments (ISE), such as BEA WebLogic Workshop 8.1, can help in developing reusable services, the real payback of investing in SOA comes when you are able to consume services within rich composite applications. Process-driven development has become acknowledged as a much more intuitive and powerful way to develop composite applications. This session will show how to model and execute business processes that span multiple systems, services, and users using process-centric constructs like sequencing, branching, system state, and causality.

Large information systems need a domain model. Development teams know this, yet they often end up with little more than data schemas. This tutorial delves into how a team, developers and domain experts together, can engage in progressively deeper exploration of their problem domain while making that understanding tangible as a practical software design.
Large information systems need a domain model. Development teams know this, yet they often end up with little more than data schemas. This tutorial delves into how a team, developers and domain experts together, can engage in progressively deeper exploration of their problem domain while making that understanding tangible as a practical software design. This model is not just a diagram or an analysis artifact. It provides the very foundation of the design, the driving force of analysis, even the basis of the language spoken on the project. The tutorial will focus on three topics: 1. The conscious use of language on the project to refine and communicate models and strengthen the connection with the implementation. 2. A subtly different style of refactoring aimed at deepening model insight, in addition to making technical improvements to the code. 3. A brief look at strategic design, which is crucial to larger projects. These are the decisions where design and politics often intersect.
President and consultant ( Domain Language ) Eric Evans specializes in domain modeling and design in large business systems and is the author of Domain-Driven Design, (Addison-Wesley 2003). Since the early 1990s, he has worked on projects developing object-oriented software in both business and technical domains. In the last four years, he has coached and trained teams in Extreme Programming and on the integration of agile development processes into diverse projects. Having repeatedly faced the challenges of creating complex business logic in elaborate technical architectures such as J2EE, and seeing how technology and other factors can overwhelm a project, Eric has concentrated on ways to focus software design effort on core business value, and on ways to design the core of a system so that it can keep pace with business needs and opportunities

This BOF will be arranged in an informal panel style. In the session we will touch topics like why we have different approaches to "wrapping" our domain models-putting them in more or less heavy-weight containers, adding features through aspects and so on. We will talk about the purpose of this wrapping, what the core questions are when selecting an approach, and maybe some characteristics, pros, and cons of different approaches.

It is not surprising that after Java 1.5 became official, that the Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 Platform exam should also be updated. However, it might come as a surprise that the new exam for Java 1.5 is radically different from earlier versions of this exam, requiring a different mindset in preparing for the new exam. Early in 2005 Sun completed beta-testing of its new Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 Platform 1.5 (SCJP 1.5) Exam. The exam is expected to be finalized in the summer of 2005. The objectives of the new exam have been revamped. The objectives emphasize understanding of Java language features and being able to understand code scenarios which use these features. Esoteric features have been omitted, and heavy emphasis put on OOP concepts, locales, stream I/O, and nearly all the new features introduced in Java 1.5 (Autoboxing/unboxing of primitive values, Enums, Foreach loop, Formatting of values, Using regular expressions with the Scanner class for parsing input, Generic types/methods/wildcards, Static import, StringBuilder class).
The talk answers pertinent questions like: How to plan, study and prepare for the SCJP 1.5 exam Where to get certification resources for the SCJP 1.5 exam, as currently no certification Books are available on the market. However, the talk will concentrate on examples of code scenarios that providing insights into a selection of important topics that appear on the new exam. Outline Please note that the Exam objectives have not been finalized at the time of writing this proposal. Java Technology Certification Overview (3 min.) New exams for J2SE and J2EE.

This session will explore Spring Web Flow (SWF), a core module of Spring's web stack, and its architecture as a powerful controller technology based on a finite-state machine.
Keith will discuss in detail SWF's capabilities, including its ability to capture web application page flows as self-contained, reusable modules that make dynamic and sophisticated page navigation decisions. Keith will demonstrate SWF's solutions to important issues facing web application developers in areas such as application transactions, duplicate submits, security, testability, browser-navigation button use, and state management. This session will also show how Spring Web Flow may be leveraged in a variety of web environments as a compliment to "traditional" controllers. You'll see how to embed flows within a number of established frameworks in the web space, including Struts, Spring MVC, and JSF. You'll also see how it integrates with the rest of the Spring Framework. You can expect to see in-action the benefits of using a declarative, test-driven approach to building page flows to orchestrate controlled navigations that drive business processes. You'll leave with an understanding on when to use Spring Web Flow, and how to use it in a best-practice manner.

The Java programming language has been tremendously successful. Many of the roots of its success may be surprising to the audience. But every major programming language has a limited life cycle. While it’s true that Java and .NET seem to be the only games in town, some alternatives are beginning to emerge. In this session, we’ll discuss some of the limitations of the Java language, and the impact that they might have on the productivity of Java developers. We’ll then look at some of the innovations around other frameworks and languages, and some of the features of those languages that boost the productivity of other non-Java developers: Typing, and why it matters Code blocks and closures Regular expressions Innovative frameworks Finally, we’ll take a look at where developers may look at using other languages. Clearly, most of the work that we do will be in Java for the foreseeable future, but certain project classifications may make it much easier to embrace alternatives, for good competitive effect.
Goals: After this session, attendees should: Understand why Java was initially successful Know where Java is coming up short Know some language features that yield better productivity Know what types of projects may be better served by other languages and platforms. Pre-requisites: Attendees should: Have a good understanding of the Java programming language Have used Java in a project Have an open mind Track: Core Java, management

Put simply, a Multi Agent System (MAS) is a computer system built as an anthill. The MAS is composed of many different, independent programs. These programs exchange messages and adapt their behavior to each other in order to solve problems. However, MAS and agent systems in general have obtained the stigma of hype since no techniques and methods have enabled programmers to implement grand and futuristic MAS designs. Here, an experimental method is presented that enables simple and fast implementation of MAS. Using Java (with two minor syntactic adaptations) as a language for inter-program communication and collaboration, MAS designs can be implemented. The Java language (with adaptations) allows each individual agent program to integrate new and existing functionality in order to adapt seamlessly and service the needs of other agent programs. A problem requiring adaptable, collaborative programs along with its MAS solution is presented, and actual and understandable examples of running programs and code are used to illustrate how old dreams can now be made reality.
Topics and time: 1. Introduction to the problem of MAS: How can we set up a program that provides a (web) service, but were both the format and the method of delivery of the service result can only be set up and adapted to client programs’ different needs at run-time? 20 min. 2. Example of a simple, implemented MAS solution using presented method: A graphical demonstration of programs run-time and an easy-to-understand presentation of the underlying program code. 15 min. 3. Java as an inter-program language – how Java can be used and the few adaptations necessary. Parallels are drawn to similar methods such as BeanShell, RPC, CORBA, and SOAP. 10 min
phd-student ( NTNU ) Presenter’s background: I.T.B. Ørstavik is a phd-student in applied linguistics and programming at HiST (AITeL) and NTNU (HF), Trondheim. The presentation is based on an experimental project going back three years and a project of six students/researchers this summer (NTNU has funded the construction of a large scale prototype with a compiling service and RTE for external use in 2005).

The tutorial will focus on real-life experience with the Spring Framework. The context for the presentation is building web applications using the framework and how to declaratively configure applications. Its main aim is to give an introduction to the most important concepts in this context. Testing is an important part of any application and how to do integration testing with the Spring framework will be demonstrated. Ideas for handy helper classes will also be discussed. Further on the presentation will focus on how to get the most out of Spring’s support for AOP and how to declaratively configure interceptor chains. Real life examples will be shown. Spring’s support for Hibernate as well as how to successfully configure Hibernate with Spring is also a topic – the aim being to get the most out of Hibernate. This part will be brief – but is nonetheless important and not as trivial as one would think! As this is a practical introduction to web application development with the Spring framework, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) tier is important. Configuration and a few examples will be demonstrated. The main goal of the presentation is to give a thorough introduction of how to configure Spring in a fast and reliable way in order to focus on building the web application itself. By providing this tutorial I aim to help the audience by providing solutions to many issues and challenges that one faces when first using the Spring framework in this context.
Development environment setup Handy helper classes Basics of testing Interceptor chaining Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) examples Spring and Hibernate Spring and JDBC Spring and MVC Required experience The participants should be familiar with the basic concepts of the Spring framework and should have some knowledge about web application development based on J2EE and MVC. Expected audience Developers and architects who are interested in learning how the Spring framework can be used as an efficient way of building web applications should attend this presentation. It will take a practical approach toward setting up an development environment, explaining the relevant components in order to get up and running and ready to focus on implementing business logic efficiently.
Systemutvikler ( Objectware ) Kristoffer Moum works as a consultant for Objectware. He has five years of experience as a J2EE developer and has approximately six months of experience with the Spring framework in two separate projects. He has a special interest in frameworks that make his life as a developer easier and more efficient. Kristoffer believes it is important to focus on producing business value and that this can be accomplished by choosing frameworks that abstract away as much unwanted complexity as possible - as well as make application code testing easy and funny.

In the last two years, ORM tools like Hibernate have become popular in the Java developer community as a part of a trend towards simplifying J2EE application development. Many of these tools support generating the database from the object-model and try in this way to minimize the required knowledge of database design, even though in practice some database design knowledge is still required. Other tools, like Prevayler, try to take this even further by eliminating the database altogether.
Another recent trend is the use of AOP for implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, caching, and even the domain logic itself, such as proposed by Rickard Öberg at the JavaZone conference in Oslo in 2004. In this talk I will present a design approach for how domain models can be described with as little information as possible, where dynamic proxies are used for managing the data and thereby realizing an even more agile and adaptive way of defining the domain model. The design is inspired by Rickard Öbergs thoughts, but avoids the use of AOP for the implementation because it doesn’t provide the necessary functionality for implementing this. I will also look at how business logic can be handled in this kind of a design by using a variant of the dependency injection pattern. The talk will also have a live demonstration of how this works and go into detail about pros and cons of such a solution.

Traditional object oriented development may work for large projects, but it’s not the right approach for most of the enterprise software that we build. Certain characteristics of technology can improve your chances of success. Some new open source technologies, like Spring and Hibernate, dramatically simplify programming by reducing complexity. Many development teams use heavyweight development technologies to solve basic problems. We overuse EJB, we use XML where it’s not the best fit, and we needlessly complicate our lives in many other ways. We’ll look at process, architectures, and technologies that can simplify your code and save you money. When the session is over, you’ll have a good understanding of the techniques that you can use to do lighter-weight, simpler development projects. You’ll know the processes that the experts favor, and the tool kits that they use to simplify their lives.
Goals: After this session, attendees should: Understand the foundations of the lightweight development movement Know some basic principles that simplify programming Understand the basic tools for dealing with complexity Get an overview of technologies that can improve development

In this presentation, we'll look in depth the new features of WebWork 2.2 that extend WebWork's existing UI tag library and embrace rich client-side interaction using JavaScript, XML, DHTML, and XmlHttpRequest. Now commonly referred to as AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), the technique of enabling rich user interaction and instant feedback has become quite popular in recent months. Using these components, we'll see that building an application like Gmail or Google Maps is much easier than it might first appear. More importantly, we'll continue to underline the importance of componentizing your web applications and show you how building reusable libraries not only lets you create richer applications, but also increases your productivity and quality of the products you develop. Lastly, we'll see how AJAX doesn't fundamentally change the MVC style of development, but rather facilitates it while still following the same principles of keeping the data on the on the server as long as possible.

An introspective of how a large utility company utilized open source to solve the problem of moving 24x7 mission critical data around an organization requiring workflow, transactions, providing/transforming data from one system and format to another with distributed components. The overall goal was to replace hundreds of small, one-off applications with an enterprise class, distributed J2EE architecture. The completed solution is a prime example of using 100% open source software to develop an enterprise class system that saved the organization a significant amount of investment in commercial software. The solution resulted in a centralized enterprise service bus architecture utilizing best-in-class architectural concepts, J2EE components and open source implementations, such as Spring, Webservices/AXIS, Hibernate, JBoss, Quartz, JBPM, EJB/MDB, JMS, and JMX/MBeans.
This presentation will focus on various aspects of the project including the overall architecture, the project’s affect on the business, the open source software used to complete the project and the many struggles throughout the project lifecycle. The project will be demonstrated and discussed throughout the discussion of the architecture and the open software used to accomplish the project goals. TOPIC OUTLINE The Problem Definition Many data formats Many incompatible systems/applications moving the data Lack of identified workflow Lack of status notification The Business Constraints Limited budget Limited time Must follow the company process The Solution Centralized management of transformations Guaranteed delivery of events and results Workflow/Task identification and management Pluggable transformation component framework Scheduled and manual implementation of tasks The Project Architecture Build system (Maven) Unit and functional tests (JUnit) Administrative web console (Struts) Scheduler (Quartz) Workflow (JBPM) Messaging event engine (JMS/MDB) Activity transformers (moving data, performing business logic) Notification (JavaMail) Using IoC effectively (JMX, Spring) Persistence to multiple data stores (Hibernate, Spring JDBC) Generation of object model and business delegates (Middlegen, XDoclet) Single sign-on (JAAS, JCIFS) Application Server (JBoss) Webservices/AXIS (SOA communication to third party systems) Operating System (Linux) Lessons Learned What worked What didn’t

Large and complex Java systems are often difficult to unit test due to tangled code, problematic design patterns and certain aspects of the Java language. This talk describes how a complimentary framework can be used to introduce unit testing in large Java enterprise systems.

As software projects grow they become increasingly unmanageable. It seems that large projects inevitably grow into huge spaghetti-like structures. One way of enforcing a clean separation of functional areas is to physically partition the code base into many separate sub-projects with clearly defined dependency relationships. There are some interesting and wide-ranging benefits that result from this approach, but new problems and issues also emerge. Many of the Java IDEs now offer features which support the development of large projects containing hundreds of separate modules. These features will be reviewed in IDEs such as IDEA, Eclipse and NetBeans. Finally, this talk will introduce and demonstrate a new build tool based upon Ant, which is designed to assist in building very large numbers of modules and sub-projects.
There will be five sections to this talk. 1. Introduction (10 minutes) Introduce key concepts: - what is a software module? - how big is it? - what terms can we all agree upon? 2. Comparing modular software to monolithic software (10 minutes) Large-scale monolithic software projects have a tendancy towards becoming 'great piles of spaghetti'. The idea of modularity is to prevent this happening, based on the observation that smaller projects are a lot easier to maintain than larger projects. Key advantages of a modular approach to software development using Java :- a) Agility - it's faster to build and test a small module than a large project. b) Architectural visibility - modules make it easier to see your project's overall structure. c) Support for major refactorings - modules make it easier to try out new ideas, integrate good ones and eject bad ones. d) Re-use - it's easier to turn useful code into common code when it's in a module. e) Architectural integrity - the code won't compile if a dependency is not explicitly declared. All these claims will be clearly explained and justified in the presentation. 3. IDE support for modularity (15 minutes) This section will be a lightning tour of a sample of Java IDEs to compare their support for developing software as a series of modules and dependencies. This will show how a modular project appears in each of these IDEs, and demonstrate supporting features of each IDE. a) IntelliJ IDEA 4.5 b) Eclipse 3 c) NetBeans 4 4. Building and testing modular software projects - demonstration (15 minutes) This final section will demonstrate mBuild, an open-source build tool based on Ant and the FreeMarker template engine. mBuild is not available today, but will be available before JavaZone 2005. The role of mBuild is to use metadata (usually contained in IDE project files) to build modules in the correct order according to rules contained in an Ant template. It helps in the development of large build systems. 5. Questions & Answers - 10 minutes Level: This is an advanced topic designed for experienced Java developers, but requires no previous experience in the subject area, which is likely to be new to most. Participants should have experience of working on a reasonably-sized Java project and ideally some experience of using Ant. Expected audience: Software developers, technically-savvy project managers and architects.

It is easy enough to design code generators that can churn out application software at a tremendous rate. But we must be aware of the perpetual tradeoffs between speed of development, and other desirable factors such as quality, security, maintainability, runtime efficiency and reliability. We do not want to carry things to extremes and generate mass-produced, inefficient software that fails to meet user requirements. The key is to strike a balance between automated efficiency and human creativity; and this is where pluggable, customisable patterns enter the picture. This presentation / demonstration will focus on automating the creation of software itself and the part pluggable, customisable patterns play, always remembering Albert Einstein's saying: "Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.

Two main goals of the EJB3 specification are developer productivity and reducing complexity, making the simple things easy and the difficult things possible. At the same time, lightweight containers such as the Spring Framework in combination with Hibernate could be a viable alternative. Enterprise architects are expected to explain the differences, advantages and drawbacks of the available technologies. It is important to see through the smokescreen to be able to explain the differences between the various alternatives and appreciate the consequences of the selected architecture.
In this session we discuss the emerging EJB3 standard in relation to lightweight containers. Central qualities such as support for business logic, persistence, transactions, testability and remote access are compared. The assessment is based on the EJB 3.0 Preview provided by JBoss 4.0, as well as experience from several large projects using Spring and Hibernate. Brief introduction to the topic - 5 min. Persistence: EJB3 Entity Beans vs. Spring ORM/Hibernate - 10 min. Business logic: EJB3 Session Beans vs. POJOs managed by Spring - 10 min.

Two emerging fields of interest to the Java developer are Java Management Extensions (JMX) and Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). This talk gives a rapid introduction to each of these areas to begin with, so that the attendee will be familiar with the terminology on leaving. Then, starting with the motivation that the application developer should be concerned about their manageability, but not have to work hard to incorporate it into their code, the talk presents a new approach to building manageability as an aspect, that is woven into the code at runtime. Annotations are shown as devices for attaching a JMX Managed Bean (Mbean) to a business object, and the potential disadvantages of doing JMX in this way will be pointed out.
Some pragmatic steps are show that the developer can take today without going to full aspect-oriented programming, so that the application design will be ready for AOP once it becomes more accepted by mainstream. Some examples of AOP will be pointed out from work done on manageability code. Finally a look to the future will be taken with the potential for JMX to be incorporated into Integrated Development Environments (IDE's).
Technical consultant ( HP ) Technical consultant with HP's software business unit Works with customers on implementing manageability for Java/J2EE/web services based applications.

This talk explains how to use JMX (Java Management Extensions) patterns in practical applications for building better manageable applications. The 7 design patterns that are described here were derived from real world projects that are now working and being managed in production. JMX has now become much more popular since it is incoporated into the Java 5.0 (Tiger) SDK. There were 5 different sessions on JMX alone at the JavaOne 2005 conference recently. More programmers will be paying attention to the production deployment parts of their applications in order to make them long-lived in the data center. This is expecially true for server-side or J2EE applications. This talk will enable the developer to avoid some pitfalls in using JMX and to make the best use of it for their application design. A white paper documenting the design patterns will also be available. The design patterns shown here build on the EJB Design patterns from F. Marinescu and the original design patterns by Gamma, Johnson, Vlissides and Helm to give the developer a more powerful language for describing manageability of their applications. The importance of profiling the JMX parts of the application will also be discussed.
Examples of some of the patterns to be discussed are : MBeanForAppConfig, MBeanHelper, MBeanLivesForever, MBeanAggregator.

In the past few years, Struts has emerged as the de-facto standard for Java web application development. It was the first major open-source framework to provide a basic Model-2 infrastructure with a host of useful features, a vibrant user community, and a strong commitment to backwards compatibility. Over the years, several competing frameworks have emerged, and in 2004, The Java Community Process released JavaServer Faces (JSF), as a new standard web user interface framework. JSF specifies a web user interface component model, complete with server-side event handling, validation, internationalization, page navigation, and declarative mapping between user interface components and Java objects. It is designed to work with JSP and other display technologies, and allow rapid development of web applications for HTML and non-HTML clients, using traditional RAD IDE metaphors.
This session begins with an explanation of what JavaServer Faces is, and how it relates to Struts and other web frameworks currently on the market. Next, it examines different strategies for using Struts and JSF together as well as migrating from Struts to JSF, discussing the pros and cons of each approach. The session ends with an overview of future directions for JSF as well as Struts, and the Struts Shale project.

Java web development has come a long way since the initial introduction of the Servlet API. Today, there are dozens of different frameworks -- dominated by Jakarta Struts -- that make web development faster and easier. However, until recently, most of these frameworks didn't mask the underlying request/response nature of HTTP, or concentrate on stateful user interface components. And only Struts has widespread industry adoption and tool support.
JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a standard web user interface framework, developed under the Java Community Process (JSR 127), and released in March, 2004. JSF specifies a web user interface component model, complete with server-side event handling, validation, internationalization, page navigation, and declarative mapping between user interface components and Java objects. It is designed to work with JSP and other display technologies, and allow rapid development of web applications for HTML and non-HTML clients, using traditional RAD IDE metaphors. This talk explains what JavaServer Faces is, and how it relates to Struts and other web frameworks currently on the market. It will cover the architecture and key JSF concepts, and also show a sample application inside of an IDE such as Sun Java Studio Creator.
Editor-in-chief of JSF Central ( JSF Central ) Kito D. Mann is editor-in-chief of JSF Central (www.jsfcentral.com) and the author of JavaServer Faces in Action (Manning). He is also a member of the JSF 1.2 and JSP 2.1 expert groups, and a consultant specializing in enterprise application architecture, development, mentoring, and JSF product strategy. Kito has consulted with several Fortune 500 clients, including Prudential Financial and J.P. Morgan Chase & Company, and was recently the chief architect of an educational application service provider. He holds a BA in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University.

Most developers have by now heard of Design Patterns, but what are they, what is their history and how are they used? This presentation will start with the historical origins - the term 'Pattern' was used already in 1677, in a way that is surprisingly close to present usage. The architect Christopher Alexander was the founder of modern usage of the term, with architectural design starting in the late 60's. The software world picked up the thread around 1993, and the movement gathered momentum with the book Design Patterns by Gamma et al in 1994. Since then, Design Patterns have appeared on many levels. Some have become standard usage, some (iterator) have even become features of programming languages. Many books have been writen on Design Patterns, but it seems that only a relatively low number remains in widespread use - and their use is perhaps less widespread than we might expect. Testimonials abound, but rigorous empirical work is quite scarce. I will present empirical data gathered during my thesis research, both from formal experiments, code analysis and project postmortems. These data show that some patterns are correlated with lower error rates than average, while other patterns show the opposite effect. Names will be named – concrete patterns have been tested and the results are clear and interesting.
After a historical introduction, as outlined in the abstract, the presentation will focus on three topics: 1) What are patterns really about? Not in an academic sense of trying to nail down a waterproof, rigorous definition, but in a practical sense – what kind of information and help should you expect from a good pattern, and what do you have to supply yourself. Design Patterns are not a silver bullet, and they won’t transmute novices into architects, claims notwithstanding. 10 minutes 2) What do we know about the practical consequences of using design patterns, from goodquality research? During my thesis research I have gathered most of the available research evidence (not much) and done a lot of research myself. In this part of the presentation, I will show what we know, and how we know it – again, in a way understandable to practitioners, not academics. An experiment performed in Germany in 1997, and repeated in an improved version in Norway in 2003, tested five different, well-known patterns: Observer, Decorator, Abstract Factory, Composite and Visitor. Their presence or absence in several test programs led to widely differing effects during maintenance and extension tasks, ranging from seemingly intuitive acceptance (Observer), via positive effects after training (Decorator), indifference (Abstract Factory, Composite) to outright harm (Visitor). Analysis of the error and modification history of a large commercial product over three years gave somewhat different results, with higher than normal error rates correlated with the presence of Observer, and markedly lower error rates for Factory. These results probably reflect the difference between the small, controlled examples used in the experiment, and the effects of real-world complexity. 25 minutes 3) Given this knowledge, how do we interpret and use it? In summary, Design Patterns are fairly widely used, and some of them have become ubiquitous by virtue of being language or standard library features and concepts. Like any sharp-edged tool they must be used with knowledge, lest they do harm. To a certain extent, the presence or absence of certain patterns can be used as a diagnostic tool, to locate program areas that warrant close inspection and above-average attention to good design. 15 minutes Required experience: Intermediate to Advanced. Participants will benefit from basic knowledge of Design Patterns, and should have experience with design and architecture, not just coding to spec. Benefit to participants: Better awareness of what Design Patterns can and cannot do for you, based on a combination of principles and practical experience.

You can hardly turn a corner without someone hollering SOA at you these days. Despite a lot of vendor attention, there is a lot of misconceptions about SOA. This presentation will try to penetrate the hype and get to the bones of what SOA is. I will attempt to dispel the lame visions of SOA presented by the vendors and show how the popular description are premature at best, harmful at worst. After mavigating between two different hyped incarnations of SOA, I will describe how we ended up creating a real world realization of SOA.

The Enterprise Java landscape has changed dramatically in the last 18 months. We've seen the return of OOP in J2EE applications, increasing adoption of agile development methods, a shift towards framework-oriented development, much greater use of open source, and the gradual rise of AOP. Many old certainties have vanished in an exciting period of innovation which will change how we all work.
Rod Johnson will discuss these and other important areas, concluding with a summary of technologies to watch in the future, and recommendations as to how Java developers can keep ahead of the curve.

The next release of the Java Wireless Toolkit (formerly the J2ME Wireless Toolkit) brings to the developer community support for three exciting JSRs. The next release will support the APIs for SATSA for smart cards (JSR 177), Location APIS (JSR 179) and the brand new Content Handler API (CHAPI, JSR 211). But it's not just the APIs.... The release has been enhanced with additional tools to aid developers when building applications for these exciting APIs. One example is the route planner, which allows you to create a route for your location sensitive application. Another new tool is the CHAPI property editor, which makes it easy to add the necessary properties to your content handler application's descriptor. Featuring hands-on demonstrations, this presentation will tell developers everything they need to know about the new Java Wireless Toolkit release.

The agile methods have virtually no Quantified focus on the quality and performance levels of the software. This means you cannot control the main benefits for users and stakeholders. This means that you cannot really control the costs, necessary in order to meet the quality needs of your users. It means the methods are not suitable for industrial products where you cannot simply get the functionality, but must compete to deliver all sorts of qualities and performance attributes.

Abstract modeling principles and patterns takes many concrete forms. Developers often ask how to bring them together in a more step-by-step fashion. Although there can never be a cook-book for modeling and design, this talk walks through the application of three rules, using an actual, recent case as an example (simplified, of course).
The case, a redesign of a currency exchange application, brought order to a complex application and prepared it for continued growth. The simple (though not easy) rules used Bounded Contexts to guide detailed design decisions, and Value Objects to weave together a collection of loosely coupled subsystems and provide a Ubiquitous Language. The talk will explain both the patterns and the rules based on them, through the example.
President and consultant ( Domain Language ) Eric Evans specializes in domain modeling and design in large business systems and is the author of Domain-Driven Design, (Addison-Wesley 2003). Since the early 1990s, he has worked on projects developing object-oriented software in both business and technical domains. In the last four years, he has coached and trained teams in Extreme Programming and on the integration of agile development processes into diverse projects. Having repeatedly faced the challenges of creating complex business logic in elaborate technical architectures such as J2EE, and seeing how technology and other factors can overwhelm a project, Eric has concentrated on ways to focus software design effort on core business value, and on ways to design the core of a system so that it can keep pace with business needs and opportunities

Mobile software development is highly volatile, risky and requires a lot of talent. Agile methods are claimed to offer support for this type of volatile development environment. Indeed, Extreme Programming and other agile methods have received a lot of attention in recent years. These methods do not contain any specific information related to complexities faced in mobile development domain concerning testing, user-centered issues or terminal variance. Mobile-D is an agile approach designed to meet the challenging demands of mobile development environment and standard quality requirements. The talk will offer an insight look into the world of agile methods, principles and solutions. The Mobile-D approach will be introduced and supportive empirical data on rework costs, defect rates and project management based on eight mobile projects will be disclosed.
1. Agile philosophy and rationale (10min) 2. Existing agile development solutions (10min) 3. Mobile-D for mobile software (15min) 4. Empirical data from 8 case projects (10min) 5. Future & conclusions (5min) = 50min.

WSRP (Web Services for Remote Portlets) is a relatively new standard which allows different portal products to be easily integrated. By allowing portlets produced from a portal be consumed by other portals we can now create truly distributed web systems. By using portals that leverage WSRP it becomes possible to enable outsourcing of web components, hence allowing individual applications to be deployed, managed, and scaled independently of the main portal. This allows for better control and higher uptime of the total system, since one can then avoid monolithic, and hence fragile, portal architectures. It also allows for new business opportunities as it enables standardization of modular ASP solutions.
This presentation will briefly outline the technical aspects of WSRP, demonstrate how it can be used to create better portal architectures, and discuss how proper usage of it can increase the business value of a portal implementation.

Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) recognises what experienced test-driven developers know -- Test-Driven Development is not really about testing. By using a vocabulary for specifying behaviour rather right. You write a specification of how the program should behave in a way that is concise, unambiguous and executable. You do this before you write the implementation, and you do it in small, repetitive steps. Changing the way you talk about a thing changes the way you think about it.
Invented by Dan North of ThoughtWorks, BDD has evolved from Test-Driven Development (Beck), Responsibility-Driven Design (Wirfs-Brock) and Domain-Driven Design (Evans). BDD can be used for specifying behaviour both at the application level as well as at the object level. The presentation will demonstrate how to do Behaviour-Driven Development at the application level using Ward Cunningham's Framework for Integrated Test (FIT), showing you: how specification by example is a powerful way to communicate behaviour how thinking of the FIT tables as being a specification of behaviour rather then tests changes the way you write the tables how declarative FIT tables helps you find the right abstractions to solve the problem how the terms we use in the FIT tables identify objects in the domain model how refactoring the tables to remove duplication can helpidentify new objects and abstractions in the domain model

Software practitioners and managers seeking to improve the quality of their software development processes often adopt new technologies without sufficient evidence that they will be effective, while other technologies are ignored despite the evidence that they most probably will be useful. As a consequence, software is often built with techniques for which we have insufficient evidence to confirm their suitability, qualities, costs, and inherent risks. This leads to a variety of problems ranging from financial losses to personal injuries. Evidence-based Software Engineering (EBSE) addresses this issue by using reliable evidence from empirical studies, practical experience, and human judgement to support decision making in the development and maintenance of software.
The talk will basically consist of two parts. Part one will give a general introduction to and motivation for EBSE with reference to similar work within the medical domain. In doing this, examples will also be taken from newly published and ongoing research on software design methods and pair programming with Java as the implementation language. The second part of the talk will focus how practitioners can use the evidence-based paradigm as part of their daily work to improve their software process. The talk will be at an introductory to intermediate level and will build on the following references: Dybå, T., Kitchenham, B.A., and Jørgensen, M. (2005) Evidence-based Software Engineering for Practitioners, IEEE Software, Vol. 22, No. 1, January/February, pp. 58-65. Kitchenham, B.A., Dybå, T., and Jørgensen, M.

In addition, results from ongoing research on a pair programming version of the last reference will also be presented in the first part of the talk.

Test-Driven Development is a buzzword that it appears no modern developer can be without. However, it is a proper understanding of the practice rather than the buzzword conformance that makes the greater difference in development. As a term TDD is often misused: it is sometimes used to mean that somewhere on a project someone is using JUnit; others use it as a synonym for "unit testing"; and others use it interchangeably with the term "Extreme Programming". In Java, JUnit is certainly one of the most popular tools employed in support of TDD. Unit testing is certainly a part of TDD, but there is more to TDD than just unit testing. And, although TDD forms a part of the code-centric practices of XP, TDD and XP are not one and the same.
This session introduces a set of core practices that can be said to characterise TDD at the unit level, embracing both the conventional view of unit testing plus its emphasis on active design. The session also demonstrates the bare minimum involved in evolving a testing framework from nothing, departing from the common reliance on JUnit to illustrate a lightweight and less intrusive approach that is more idiomatic in style to Java.

The Jakarta Struts framework is the de facto standard for web applications development in Java. Unfortunately, one of the primary difficulties with Struts-based development is that a lot of relationships are defined in a declarative manner, which leads to errors not being found at compilation-time. Furthermore, the system is developed in three different types of files: Java class files, Java ServerPages (JSPs), and XML configuration files. It is difficult to comprehend how these relationships interact, both, statically and dynamically (especially for a person not involved with the original development of a system).
Modeling can greatly help in the understand of these relationships: (1) From a static point of view, page flow diagrams show how JSPs, user-defined classes, and Struts constructs (e.g. action mappings) relate (e.g. shows which JSP uses which action mapping); and (2) From a dynamic point of view, sequence diagrams show when/how specific action objects are invoked and when/how objects are placed in a scope. The technique discussed in this session has been discussed with over twenty professional Struts developers and actively used by ten on a real-word project. The talk will also cover the advantages and disadvantages of proprietary (non-UML based) Struts tools, mainly M7’s NitroX for Eclipse.

While many think of MDA as just a way of separating Platform Independent Models (PIMs) and Platform Specific Models (PSMs), and then generating code from PIMs, the real advantage lies in model-to-model transformation, code generation being one kind of transformation. Working only in the PIM and generating code from it is not very practical and lacks flexibility. A different solution is needed. In this session you will see how model-to-model transformation using Query View Transformation (QVT) and Object Constraint Language (OCL2) works. What are the benefits with this approach? How can you achieve true inter- and intra-model traceability between PIMs and PSMs to get around the limitations of model-synchronization?
Required experience: TBA Expected audience: Developers and IT professionals interested in MDA

Traditional n-tier applications are quite inflexible to changes in the domain model. A common architecture is to use data transfer objects (DTO) between client and server. A change in the domain model will imply changes in many places; in the DTO layer itself, in the DTO to client mapping layer, in the server to DTO layer, in the domain/business layer and finally in the persistence layer. This is a very tedious and error-prone approach. As part of the ModelWare EU-project, WesternGeco has developed a framework that supports a transparent and shared domain-model between client and server. All persistence needs are handled on-demand, meaning that there is no need to explicitly define what should be created, retrieved, updated, or deleted (CRUD). All such operations are available from a remote client, where Java dynamic proxies takes care of tracking what needs to be done . Changes to the domain model needs to be done only in a single place; - in the domain layer itself. The framework is flexible with respect to communication middleware and persistence layer. The CRUD part of the domain-model is generated from UML class-diagrams, while the business behavior is hooked in as conventional Java classes.
This talk will explain and demonstrate the framework by a real example; a requirements management system (Precise) built as an Eclipse plugin. This application is also built as part of the ModelWare project. The implementation uses Hessian for communication, Jetty as servlet container, Hibernate with MySQL as the DBMS, and Eclipse plugin as a client application using the framework. The modularity of the 11 modules is taken care of by using Maven 2 for dependency handling. Other tools tested to ensure proper modularity are: Tomcat, Burlap, PostgreSql, HSQLDB, and db4Objects.

This talk covers Java Management Extensions (JMX) in Java EE, existing tools to manage and monitor your Java EE based applications, as well as examples of how you can implement application-specific management of your own applications using JMX technology. The session starts with an introduction to the management and monitoring information provided by the Java EE platform, and shows how to use JConsole and MC4J to tap into the wealth of monitoring information provided by the Java EE platform and the Tomcat server. JConsole (included in JDK 5.0) and MC4J are monitoring and management tools that provide information on performance and resource consumption of applications using JMX technology. Secondly, we are going to look into different aspects of application-specific management, and how JMX MBeans allows you to configure, manage and monitor your application. The last part of the presentation demonstrates some of these aspects on a Java EE application using the Spring Framework. When you attend this session you will be acquainted with some of the existing tools for managing and monitoring JMX-enabled platforms and applications, and should be able to start implementing application-specific management for your own application through JMX MBeans.
Intro (5 min) o Short intro to JMX o Management environment in Java EE 5 Connect to provided MBeans (15 min) o J2EE Management (JSR 77) o VM-provided and platform-provided MBeans o Demo : JConsole o Demo : MC4J Application specific MBeans (15 min) o Areas of application management o Building a manageable application with Spring o Best practices / lessons learned Demonstrations (15 min) o Configuration of logging o JMX and Ajax o Application statistics Q & A (10 mins) Duration 50 minutes with 10 minutes to Q and A. Language Norwegian Level: Intermediate Required experience General JEE knowledge, interest in JMX technology and examples of good use of JMX.

My MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a well known architecture for bridging the gap between the user’s mental model and a computer. MVC supports the user illusion of working directly with the domain information (models) as seen in different perspectives and presented in different views. All I/O code is pulled out of the model programs; making them simpler and more readable. The MVC is particularly applicable to situations with complex information and knowledgeable users. My DCA (Data-Collaboration-Algorithm) is a new architecture for creating simple solutions to complex problems. It uses a divide and conquer approach to hide object substructures within components that appear as regular objects in their environment. The DCA architecture further simplifies the internals of complex components; data and collaboration aspects are refined and made explicit in specialized data and interaction objects. The result is disentangled and more intelligible code with member objects being purified to implement the essential algorithms only.
Outline 1) Intro (4 min) The BabyUML project - “The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity” 2) The well-known MVC: Model – View – Controller (15 min) a) Goal and abstract architecture. b) Example demo for whole talk: Project panning with activity network. c) MVC Structure. View and controller details. d) Behavior example: Controller coordinates selection. Example code. 3) The new DCA component separates Data – Collaboration - Algorithm a) Data as base relations (a “micro database”). Code explicitly declares “What are the objects”? b) Collaboration as a temporary relations; queries. Provides a tailored object structure. Code explicitly declares “How are they interconnected”? c) Algorithm specifies interobject interaction. Code explicitly defines “How do they interact?” d) Two code examples: i) A View access base objects through a collaboration. ii) A network method (frontloading) access database through a different collaboration. 4) Summary and conclusion (6 min) a) MVC and DCA paradigms summary b) Critique: when to use and not use MVC and DCA c) Final claim: MVC and DCA scales! 5) Q and A (10 min) Duration 50 minutes + 10 minutes to Q and A and transition to next talk. Language English or Norwegian as preferred by organizers. Level Intermediate Required experience Some knowledge of Java. Expected audience The talk is for system designers and architects who will see novel principles for structuring complex systems of interacting objects. The goal is to build self-documenting systems that can be modified with confidence.

The use of design patterns in our applications gives us a great tool for communicating design decisions, and represents best practices for solving recurring design problems, but they can also be quite cumbersome to write. In this talk I will take a look at some of the classic Gang of Four patterns and contrast the Javabased and AspectJbased implementations. I will also illustrate that some of these patterns are much easier to grasp and that some are no longer needed with AOP.

Models are often viewed as something you create during design time and use to generate code. What if we turn the approach upside-down and generate models from code? Humans are very good at recognizing patterns in images, making visualizations a valuable tool to, for example, recognize dependencies or data flow. This is particularly true for dynamic, loosely coupled systems that are often less explicit and evolve over time. Once you have generated a model you can take things a step further and run checks and validations against it. Visualizations can also be used to plot out source code metrics over various dimensions to detect potential “hot spots” in the application that may require special attention.
This session applies the concepts of visualization and model generation to a broad range of usage scenarios, such as asynchronous messaging, software components and object-oriented applications.

Quite often when teams are faced with the pressure of dealing with poor performance, the first instinct is to revert to those development techniques that are all so like your favorite pair of slippers. The problem is, it is almost impossible to diagnose a performance problem using static analysis of the code. To be successful (rather then lucky) one must be able to acquire dynamic data from the runtime and then be able to understand what that data is telling them. This talk will dive into how one can instrument J2EE/J2SE applications to diagnose performance problems. But since power point slides are cheap, we will minimize time looking at them in favor of spending more time solving performance problems together.

Father of Spring Framework ( Interface21 ) Rod is the father of Spring. The Spring Framework open source project began in February 2003, based on the Interface21 framework published with Rod's best-selling Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development. Rod is one of the world's leading authorities on Java and J2EE development. He is a best-selling author, experienced consultant, and open source developer, as well as a popular conference speaker. Rod's best-selling Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development (2002) was one of the most influential books ever published on J2EE. The sequel, J2EE without EJB (July 2004, with Juergen Hoeller), has proven almost equally significant, establishing a comprehensive vision for lightweight, post-EJB J2EE development. Rod has extensive experience as a consultant in a wide range of industries: principally, finance, media and insurance. He has specialized in server-side Java development since 1996. Prior to that, he worked mainly in C and C++. His experience as a consultant has led him to see problems from a client's perspective as well as a technology perspective, and has driven his influential criticism of bloated, inefficient, orthodox approaches to J2EE architecture, which have delivered very poor results for stakeholders. Rod is the founder of the Spring Framework, which began from code published with Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development. Along with Juergen Hoeller, he continues to lead the development of Spring. He regularly speaks at conferences in the US, Europe and Asia, including the ServerSide Symposium (2003, 2004 and 2005), JavaPolis (Europe's leading Java conference), and JAOO (2004). Engagements in 2005 include two presentations at JavaOne 2005 and a keynote at the JavaWorld 2005 conference (Tokyo, June). Rod serves in the JCP on the Expert Groups defining the Servlet 2.4 and JDO 2.0 specifications. Rod continues to be actively involved in client projects at Interface21, as well as Spring development, writing and evangelism.

Client side applications are notoriously difficult to test, with many of the traditional approaches leveraging screen scraping techniques resulting in both brittle and costly tests. There are a number of alternative ways of testing Swing GUIs, and we will be looking at one of these that make testing Swing applications easier and more reliable. We will investigate how you can apply this testing technique for TDDing an entire Swing application that will be both robust and reliable. We will look at how you write acceptance level tests and the patterns that you could implement in a swing application that allows you to fully test all the components before you get an acceptance test passing. We will demonstrate the robustness of tests by demonstrating how you can changing the way the components are laid out without breaking tests. We will also discuss all the difficulties, tips and tricks that you should be aware when you do decide to write tests for your application.

Memory management problems in object oriented programming languages are so serious that Java provides automatic garbage collection. Unfortunately problems of efficiency and space leaks remain. Early detection of these is vital but is complicated by the fact that these problems often do not show unless a program is run for an extended time which can happen after testing occurs. This paper considers what tools a Java programmer can use to monitor memory use and detect problems as early as possible.

The NetBeans™ 5.0 IDE introduced a next-generation GUI builder tool that radically simplifies layout design of Swing based-GUIs. It has never been easier to design professional UIs that can run on various platforms, be translated to different languages, look good, and behave consistently. All that without the usual need of fighting with layout managers. In this presentation, the developers of the NetBeans GUI Builder (formerly code-named "Matisse") take you through a tour of the GUI builder, demoing and explaining main features, and focusing on how to solve typical UI design problems. The session presents various tips and tricks for layout design and effective use of the Swing in a GUI builder. See how to internationalize the UI, how to use custom components, and more. Learn from the experts about the main principles of cross-platform UI design, UI guidelines in layout, comparison of various approaches and design styles, and typical mistakes to avoid. Last but not least, the Matisse authors reveal some new things being prepared for the next release and ideas about the future of the GUI builders field. Overall, the presentation provides a solid theoretical and practical basis for anyone who needs to quickly create a good-looking Swing UI that just works. The session requires a basic level of prior experience in programming Swing GUIs and using GUI builder tools.

Java allows the experienced developer to write highly flexible code, especially when using dynamic features like proxies and references. In this talk, we bring these together with generics and enums. We will demonstrate some approaches of using Java's dynamic proxies to create virtual proxies, protection proxies, dynamic object adapters and dynamic decorators. A part of the talk will also explore the performance implications and compare it with the benefits gained. P.S. If you are wondering why "enum" is listed under "advanced features" you should definitely attend this talk.

The software development community is at an interesting inflection point. Distributed and interconnected systems are becoming the norm for new development efforts to the extent that the word "application" itself might have to be redefined. Loosely coupled solutions, such as Service-Oriented Architectures, enable independent variability and evolution of components. While many of the architectural benefits of SOA have been belabored over and over we are often kept wondering what it means for developers to code in a service-oriented environment. Will business analysts wire together components in visual tools and make developers obsolete? What kind of new tools should we expect to see? Are there new patterns and guidelines to follow? How can you get ready?

This session covers application design and development in distributed and high performance environments, in particular John will contrast and compare some of today's caching and grid technologies providing real-life use-cases. Rather than bake one technology off against the other John aims to demonstrate their unique benefits and show that, in many cases, they actually compliment each other. Grid and caching have evolved around the needs of high performance, large volumes, low latency and complex data, messages today are orders of magnitude more complex than 20 years ago, volumes are on a global scale and we need everything through in increasingly shorter time scales. From his perspective of the banking world John will demonstrate processing of complex financial derivatives through several vendor products; Modelling and Java Binding with C24's Integration Objects, High performance Web Services and a distributed ESB with IONA's Artix, eliminating the database with Tangosol's Coherence and distributed High Performance Computing with GigaSpaces.
Agenda Introduction Primer to the needs of the banking world Case Studies (code & demo) o Message complexity and modelling o Integration, EAI, SOA and ESBs o Data Caching o High Performance Computing Q&A

Interoperability in software, systems and technologies is seen in the marketplace as important as security and reliability. At Microsoft, interoperability is now a core part of our initiatives to make computing more trustworthy. We believe, that interoperability is achieved by design, collaboration and standards. Interoperability based on standards is just one part of a bigger picture, the whole story goes well beyond that: it is about business (processes) and people, and the needs of both suggest how IT should behave. We will discuss an architectural case that provides some evidence for this holistic perspective on interoperability. And of course we’ll give an overview of some interoperability work in core technology areas that are of interest to the Java community (e.g. WS- , SOA, Open XML vs. ODF etc).

Not all memory leaks are the same. Some eat away at memory slowly over time. Others grab huge chunks of memory all at once. What is common for most of them is that they ultimately cause the virtual machine's heap to run out of space. A large variety of tools provides a high-level view of a Java™ application's memory usage, but not all of them are appropriate for doing the detailed analysis needed to find the cause of a memory leak. Depending on the type of memory leak, some tools are more appropriate than others. This BOF session examines some of the tools and techniques available and uses example memory leaks from real-world Java applications.
The presentation shows how to track down a memory leak where multiple object instances of the same class are created over time, some of which are the source of a leak and others of which are not. It also examines how to debug a memory leak where only a single object instance is the source of the problem. Each of these examples involves a brief examination of the source code and a demonstration using a monitoring/profiling tool. Comparisons are done between the two different situations and the capabilities of the different tools. 1. The easy part: watching the heap and learning you have a problem (15 minutes) 1.1 JVM Command line parameters and associated tools 1.2 VisualGC 1.3 JConsole and other JDK tools 2. A huge object taking up heap space (15 minutes) 2.1 Sample application description 2.2 Heap walking: how to's and what to watch out for 2.3 Using a heap walker to track down the problem 3. A slow death: a small leak that adds up over time (15 minutes) 3.1 Sample application description 3.2 A statistical approach to memory leak detection: pros and cons 3.3 Using a statistical approach to track down a small leak 4.

 Spring Web services (Spring-WS) is a new product from the Spring community that aims to help developing document-driven Web services. In this talk, we will describe the difference between RPC and document-driven Web services, and show that most document-driven Web services are actually RPC in disguise! Additionally, we will show how to implement the following features using Spring-WS: Validating requests and responses the difference between SOAP vs. REST XML Marshalling with Castor, JAXB, JiBX and others Binding domain objects to incoming and outgoing Web service messages Besides showing how to implement these features, we also talk about the possible dangers of them.
After a brief introduction and agenda, we talk about the properties of RPC-based en document-based Web services. We will investigate how these latter services can be built in Spring-WS, and shortly describe what the advantages and disadvantages are to a RPC-approach. Next, we cover the aforementioned list of features: we investigate the worth of each item, and how it can be implemented with Spring-WS. Required experience: Knowledge of XML en SOAP required; Spring knowledge useful Expected audience: Spring users, Web service developers

This session covers application development considerations for achieving maximum scalable performance and reliability in clustered Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) environments, improving the scalability and scalable performance of applications through the use of clustered caching to reliably share live data among clustered Java Virtual Machine (JVM) machines in the application tier, providing transparent failover as a key element of uninterrupted operation, and reduced load on the database tier as a key element of scalability. The concept behind the material is quite simple: When it comes to distributed caching, I've seen a lot of approaches that work well and a few too many that don't. The presentation will explain why certain approaches work well, and gives specific suggestions as to how applications should be architected to make optimal use of distributed caching. Attendees Will Learn Cache aside, read/write through and write behind architectures, where and when to use Caching Topologies: the limitations, trade-offs and benefits The 12 essential lessons of Distributed Caching Use cases and a topology quiz

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been among the great hypes within the software industry lately. Product vendors are currently presenting SOA as the solution to virtually all problems although many of them forget what it is all about - building good service contracts that are focused on solving real-life requirements rather than the technology of which can be used to realize a proper SOA. This presentation will address how services in a SOA context can be designed to evolve over time. This will be illustrated by examples in a non-vendor proprietary context. Attendees should learn how public services should be created in order to make them maintainable and evolvable over time. Also, the term SOA itself isn't as important as focusing on service contracts. The public service contract is more important than any term, product vendor and technology.. Also SOA is more than SOAP.
Evolving Services Business requirements evolve over time and this has to be reflected in services. However, in a SOA context, one cannot constantly deploy services that are not backwards compatible. Evolvability is a term that relates to services representing constantly changing business requirements. Such services are decorated over time, they must be backward compatible and they are not allowed to break existing service APIs. Outline Goals Term definitions Services in an enterprise context Maintaining services - by example: Example1: Technology driven Example2: More or less technology driven Example3: Contract driven Example4: Evolving services Summary Q&A

If we take closer look at the majority of applications in a given organization, integration is done on an ad-hoc basis. As time goes by and the application portfolio grows, the interconnection between the systems and applications start looking like a coral reef: hard and stiff inside, and with some life on the outside. Fumbling with the hard coupled integration points can potentially invoke a cascade of side effects, causing nobody to dare correct the root cause of the problems. Often, people just fix the symptoms by adding a new layer on top of the coral reef of highly coupled systems and applications. To avoid this pit fall, we need to shift the way we think of. We need to accept that IT systems evolve, and the way the organization needs support from them changes. This can only be fulfilled by choosing an integration strategy that is complementary with the evolution of its IT facilities. The talk is a practical story on how a system can evolve from a regular closed system to a dynamic system with unlimited integration points. The talk will reference the EAI patterns described in Gregor Hohpe’s book and map those to real life scenarios.

Current approaches to SOA state that services are silos of functional code that make up composite applications. Both Web Services and ESB approaches are not good at managing shared state of service architectures. Stateful SOA applications are distributed applications that require integration with each other on two dimensions: communication and state. Many workflow scenarios fall into this category, as well as distributed computing applications. Normally, states are shared through a centralized resource – such as a file system or a database -- which often creates a scalability and performance bottleneck. Maintaining consistency in such environments also requires the use of a distributed transaction coordinator with an XA interface, which significantly impairs performance. This session will demonstrate how Mule and JavaSpaces can offer a single integrated solution for both delivering the messages and sharing state. The solution is based on a common clustering architecture and deployment environment.

The talk will present experiences gathered in analysis and correction of performance and stability problems with BEA WebLogic and IBM WebSphere application servers and JVMs in general. The talk will not be product oriented, the topics presented are equally applicable to all servers/Java environments, although examples given may discuss features of popular application servers. The talk will outline simple measures to take when performing an analysis of perceived stability and performance problems. The talk will introduce experiences with both vendor, third party and freely available tools along with features of homebrewed tools. I will discuss some myths arising from vendor's best performance recommendations, possibly attempting to dispel some of them. Experiences in deployment topology will be among these. Some experiences not often discussed when reviewing vendor supplied "best-practices" whitepapers will be discussed. Part of the talk will delve into the JVM itself and attempt to explain what is going on in some frequently encountered failure situations and indications that may give you some forewarning. Some simple tools for analysis of JVM runtime behavior will be discussed. The Java Management Extensions (JMX) will be featured sprinkled throughout the talk and the role JMX can and should have in application development and deployment will be discussed.
Common traits of Application Servers Resources (get a handle on resource usage) Resources how much is too much? (very common questions surround things like thread pool, JDBC pools heap size. I will try to come up with some kind of pointers as to what may be good values and what are outrageous ones. Failure situations associated with poor resource control will be discussed like "out of memory" errors and "resource handle depletion") VMs: tuning (important aspect of good application server behavior, especially with regards to heap sizes and types.) VMs: what is going on? (How we can learn something about what the VM is doing in various situations, brief look at various garbage collection mechanisms that are available.) A kingdom for a stack trace! (How and what can be learnt form them, use them as a mechanism to analyze serious code problems that hinder maximum throughput) Performance and stability tools. Commercial offerings Make your own nix tools for dummies Use JMX JMX in application servers JMX tooling What is wrong with your test and development environment (often overlooked differences with test and development environments and how to simulate.) Never trust the flyers (Some real world examples of why vendor whitepapers often does not survive a reality check.) Q&A

Much has been said about Service Oriented Architecture lately and everyone seems to have their own interpretation of what SOA really is. Not many have focused primarily on the core part of SOA – Services. This talk will not be about SOA and how it is the solution to all your problems. The focus in this talk will be on services and what a service really is in the SOA context. In the beginning of the talk I will introduce four conceptual service layers. We will then dwelve into an example guided tour outlining the characteristics of the different service layers. Characteristics include contractual elements, implementation strategies, implementation technologies and guidance of the correct choices.

Kjartan is working as a consultant at Objectware AS and has about 6 years of programming experience primarily working with J2EE. He has lately been focusing on Service Oriented Architecture and services in specific.

Service engineering is becoming a discipline in its own right, not only in telecom but in the ICT world at large. It is challenging because services tend to depend on each other, be distributed and dynamic. High demands on time to market, compositionality and robustness make the life of service developers hard. The trend is towards loosely coupled and collaborative services both in the business and the telecom/embedded domain. To master these challenges it is necessary to understand the fundamental nature of services and service composition, and provide tools, platforms and methodologies to support them. Considering the widespread use of services and the attention received by service providing systems and architectures (e.g., SOA), surprisingly few approaches actually do this. Most approaches are targeting the business domain and neglect the communication/embedded domain. This is unreasonable since these domains are increasingly being merged. We present a model-driven approach to convergent service engineering. It considers a service as a collaboration involving loosely coupled objects playing different roles. Service development starts by specifying the behaviour of collaborations and roles. The roles are then composed into active objects with precise behaviour descriptions in form of state machines, which are checked for consistency and then automatically translated to Java code. To facilitate the approach, we developed the Eclipse-based tool suite Ramses. It supports editing of state machines, automatic code generation, visualization of running systems, and extensive consistency checks based on new and scalable principles. It has been successfully applied on student projects to develop a large number of demonstrator services.

From being something mostly associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and highly specialized Expert Systems in the early 90’s, Rule Engine Technology now seems to get a more important role in “ordinary” enterprise software architectures. This is most noticeable in the platform vendor space, where Rule Engine Technology is pointed out as one of the key component of a well-designed Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). These components are referred to as Business Rules Engines (BRE).   Selvaag BlueThink have several years of experience using Rule Engine Technology developing complex rule-based systems for the construction industry. The main motivation has been to offer flexibility in business critical applications, shorten the development time, along with the opportunity to implement products with great complexity. This presentation will give an introduction to Java based Rule Engine Technology in general, and insight into experiences from the development of one of Selvaag BlueThinks products, the Intelligent House Configurator (IHC). IHC is an application supporting the design/configuration process of housing products. This process is highly complex and the users must deal with an extreme amount of configuration parameters. Rule Engine Technology has shown it self as well suited for solving these problems.

Integration solutions have traditionally required the use of non-standard technologies to create functional systems. Java Business Integration (JBI) specification (JSR 208) defines the core of a service oriented integration bus and component architecture for SOA. It standardizes the common message routing architecture, plug-in interfaces for service engines and bindings, and a mechanism (Composite Service Description) to combine multiple services into a single executable and auditable unit of work. The presentation will include a demonstration using the OpenESB product. OpenESB is an open source, ESB implementation based from the ground-up on the JBI standard.

Based on actual real-world experiences (with names and details changed to protect the guilty), in this session Jonathan Purdy shares some of the best-kept secrets in the industry, including architecture and development tips that are certain to push projects over budget and beyond deadlines. Mr. Purdy will count down through the 10 biggest mistakes that lead to project failure, from specifying the wrong mechanism for data access to failure to do system testing throughout the development process. He will also discuss the best and worst practices for eliminating single points of failure in Java EE applications. A number of case studies will be presented as "evil rules", i.e. a tongue-in-cheek "do this to totally botch stuff up" set of instructions, which will show how something that seems reasonable at first blush is actually quite dangerous. Some attendees may mistakenly use this information to avoid pitfalls, errors, and other common causes of project failure.
Overall Presentation Goal: In these slides, you will see why that zillion dollar project failed. You’ll likely laugh - you’ll want to cry! To see these practices revealed. Agenda The Top Ten Ways to Botch an Enterprise Java Application Eliminating SPOFs 4 Evil Rules For Designing Non-Scalable Applications Q&A

The "anemic domain model" antipattern was proposed by Martin Fowler in 2003. The antipattern describes how domain objects often become data containers instead of exhibiting behaviour. Part of the problem is making model objects aware of the persistence mechanism used so they can make changes to the persisted state of a system. Telio has since the summer of 2005 been using dependency injection (DI) in domain objects to alleviate parts of this problem. The session will show the architecture of the solution in use at Telio, which is based on Spring and Hibernate. The technique that is described has its own set of problems. Some of these problems will be dealt with in the talk.
Walkthrough of the transaction script, domain model and anemic domain model patterns Using hibernate interceptors to inject dependencies Using the @Configurable annotation to inject dependencies (example) Comparison of the two injection technologies Comparison of the effects of applying the domain model pattern in a production application Summary and questions

Because of our expertise in online store web-application development, we were asked to develop yet another online storefront application by a company extending its business to online sales. Starting this new project was just about the right time to get started with JSF. Strong of our experience in such missions and outlining the requirements to the client, we soon realized a few pitfalls of the JavaServer Faces technology for such public website development. Stepping through the usual development process we encountered challenges using this new technology. Still we kept on going with it, solving every aspect of the problems coming across. Resulting is a web-application making use of JSF, Spring and Hibernate. We would like to share our experience solving the problems we ran into with JSF developing such a public web-application, like: proper doc-type declaration, templating, EL (c:forEach, c:if tags), search- engine friendly URLs, ... We also show how to make JSF integrate smoothly with the Spring framework and Hibernate ORM. This talk will cover the complete application development cycles as we implemented the solution for our client, showing how Java, using JSF together with other commonly used frameworks, enabled us to deliver a high quality web-application meeting the requirements of such public commercial websites.
Presentation Introduction - Introduction of the talk (what you’ll learn and so on) The mission - Project evaluation and requirements definition Architecture - This will cover what decision were made and why The JavaServer Faces technology - First why we have decided to give JSF a chance Templating Facelets Shale - Covering templating, we’ll see how these two technologies did not pass our tests and were both rejected for the project Separation of concerns The Spring Framework Hibernate ORM service - We’ll cover the integration of JSF with these both well-known and widely adopted frameworks Wiring everything - Actual deployment of the solution Front-end JSPX URL based navigation Internationalization - This part will cover how JSF did suit the requirements set and what problems were encountered actually fulfilling these Backend Remoting - Covers how the solution was managed by the customer Conclusion Q&A

The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a Java-centric framework for creating AJAX applications. GWT cross-compiles Java source into JavaScript, allowing Java developers to use their existing Java skills and tools to easily create AJAX applications with virtually no learning curve. After a short introduction to GWT, we will dive quickly into a few key topics including high-performance AJAX, internationalization, and integration with existing web applications.
- What is GWT? A short introduction to GWT with a "Hello, world" demo. - What capabilities does GWT provide? - What kind of skills are needed to use GWT? - Why did we choose Java as the source language? - Why does translating Java into JavaScript make sense? - Why didn't you do X instead? (where X is a huge list of alternative ideas) - How to internationalize GWT applications. - How to maximize performance of GWT applications. - How to integrate GWT with existing web applications. Intended audience: (The topics are of general interest to all types of audience members, but probably skewed toward Developers, Architects and Technical Managers) Developers, Architects, Project leaders, Technical managers Level: Intermediate-to-advanced, although since GWT is relatively new, the bar for "advanced" isn't that high yet.
Software Engineer and Tech Lead Bruce Johnson is a Google Software Engineer and Tech Lead of the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). Prior to joining Google, Bruce cut his product teeth as lead developer of AppForge's MobileVB product. His experience writing a Visual Basic cross-compiler was slightly fun (in a masochistic way), designing a portable version of Microsoft COM for non-MS embedded devices was much funner, but, without question, cross-compiling Java into JavaScript for GWT is the funnest. Despite his recent Java focus, Bruce will always be a Bjarne Stroustrup groupie, and he keeps a copy of D&E in his night-stand.

Traditional web applications are incredibly vulnerable to bugs and performance problems relating to state management. Developers are forced to handle issues like back button navigation, multiwindow browsing, and session size management in an utterly ad-hoc fashion. Web frameworks offer only extremely fragile state management constructs such as HttpSession and HttpRequest. Access to transactional components from the web tier has also been problematic. J2EE provided no way to have simultaneous access to state held in contexts associated with the web request, and state held in transactional resources accessed via EJB. Finally, J2EE had no first-class construct for representing state associated with a long-running business process.
JBoss Seam is a new application framework for Java EE 5 that introduces the notion of declarative, contextual, application state management. Seam integrates EJB 3.0 with JSF and, optionally, business process management via jBPM, providing a uniform component model for Java EE. This presentation will discuss problems affecting stateful web applications, introduce Seam’s declarative state management model, and demonstrate how easy it is to build robust web applications using EJB 3.0, JSF, and Seam.
King – Hibernate Architect ( Jboss ) Gavin King is the founder of the Hibernate project. He was born in a country town named Mudgee in 1974 and has never been there since. He is currently based in Melbourne, Australia - the city with the world's highest ratio of restaurants to people. Gavin's interest in persistence was sparked at the age of 11 when his early software development efforts were all destroyed due to the notorious unreliability of the Commodore 64 cassette drive. Gavin studied mathematics at Monash University before deciding to do something useful instead. He now works for JBoss, Inc., developing Hibernate and the new Hibernate-based CMP engine - and hopes he has finally proved his usefulness. He is co-author of the book, Hibernate in Action, to be published by Manning. He is also involved in the EJB3 expert group. Gavin always enjoys writing about himself in the third person.

Can a client-side Ajax solution and server-side Faces solution co-exist and play well together? Or are they each solving a similar problem in a different and incompatible way? This session will discuss how the JavaServer Faces framework can be used to embrace Ajax today, while protecting Web applications from radical rearchitecture each time there is a change in direction of client-side technology. The session will address key aspects of Faces component development, and introduce innovative techniques to adopt Ajax. Jonas and John will discuss how to best leverage Ajax to create extremely interactive rich Internet components, and issues that developers encounter when building Ajax-enabled JSF components. The session will also cover advanced techniques such as dynamic content type negotiation, JAR-based resource delivery, and dynamic render kit selection. The presenters will be using the Dojo toolkit in combination with JSF, HTML and XUL to illustrate their points.

Aranea is a web framework that facilitates Object-Oriented techniques like encapsulation and polymorphism by using POJO components, explicitly managed by the programmer. Aranea is also a full-stack web framework providing both a powerful controller that supports nested flows, and a custom JSP tag library. This talk however is not so much about Aranea (which we dive through in about 10 minutes), but about the object-oriented programming techniques applied to the web development. We want to show how usual OO idioms and patterns can make challenging tasks suprisingly simple and how many inherent problems just seem to go away. We will also briefly discuss the integration facilities that Aranea provides and how it can help to unite the fragmented web framework ecosystem.

You’ve heard the terms. You’ve seen the debates on the blogs. But what does it really come down to? What are SOAP and REST? Is one actually better than the other? Is SOAP too complex? Is REST too simple? Does Amazon’s REST API really get 5 times more usage than the SOAP one? Does this mean you shouldn’t bother with SOAP? This talk will pit the REST and SOAP against each other in an attempt to come to some answers as to which one you should choose!
Outline What is REST? What is SOAP? Debate topics: Are SOAP and REST opposed to each other? Is SOAP too complex? Is REST too simple? What is easier to get started with as a web service writer? What is easier to get started with as a service consumer in Java? In .NET? In Ruby? What about transactions, reliability? What pitfalls are there to each approach? (Ideally the audience would share some experiences here). Conclusions on when to use SOAP and when to use REST

The convergence of the telecom and the IT industry has enabled new and innovative applications and services. Telecom operators are starting to provide open API's (such as OSA / PARLAY and CPA) that the application developers can use to get the position of the mobile, send and receive SMS and MMS, and to set up calls between mobile phones. Most operators today support IP communication (GRPS/3g) with the mobile. The Mobile network and the Internet have thus merged into a technology arena where the IP protocol integrates the different worlds together. This trend will be further strengthened when laptops come equipped with 3g connectivity. The combination of Java enabled (J2ME) mobile phones and GPRS/3g, enables programs running on the mobile phones to communicate with application servers being somewhere on the Internet. In this way a broader market for applications and services is emerging. However, the telecom and the information system industry have different demands on the underlying architecture and communication mechanisms needed to support distributed applications. The telecom industry uses a Peer-2-Peer architecture where the distributed applications communicate asynchronously using messages (objects that contain the information). This is necessary in a world where all parts can take the initiative to a communication and are inherently distributed. The information system industry uses client-Server architecture. This is sufficient where only the client application (user) takes the initiative. In a truly convergent framework both have to be supported, but how can this be done? Ericsson (and now TellU as subcontractor to Ericsson) has as part of the ARTS research project, developed a Java framework (ServiceFrame) designed to become the desired converged technology platform. It can support loosely coupled applications that can be transparently distributed on Java enabled mobile phones as well as on application servers. This talk will present the underlying principles of ServiceFrame and how they are used to bridge the two worlds together.

Next Generation Mobile Java is a platform that brings the service-oriented architecture defined in JSR-232 to the mobile space. The platform promotes the creation of components and services which can be reused and extended, providing at the same time a framework to control their installation, management and security. The platform is built on the foundations of the OSGi framework and the JSR-232 environment. Next Generation Mobile Java provides the developer with a rich environment for the development of applications and services including support for applications using the MIDlet application model. This feature lets MIDP developers leverage their existing expertise and further enrich their applications using product quality services and components supplied by the platform itself or by third-party developers. In this tutorial we will introduce the Next Generation Mobile Java platform and show how applications are supported. We will then focus on the extended MIDlet application model and how it can be used to get the most benefit from the platform. We will show the full development cycle of an application using the MIDlet application model that uses the framework’s features, including shared packages, built-in and external services and the framework’s event bus. We will demonstrate the tools used to package and deploy such applications to a real device.

Creating standalone applications for your mobile device can be fun, say a tip calculator or currency converter. However, we're talking about a CONNECTED device, so let's build an application that connects to something. Hey, how about our enterprise data center - so for example, I could track the status of my machines from anywhere in the world? And what if I could build that application using a drag & drop visual designer? Get it to seamlessly run on emulators from Nokia, Sprint and others? Better yet, how about using a debugger to walk through the application as it runs on my very own phone? All of this is possible today using NetBeans Mobility. This session is an introduction to J2ME development and demonstrates the features of the NetBeans Mobility Pack.

Mobile based user authentication has been around for almost a decade, but has never really been a success due to lack of user friendliness, insufficient security or proprietary solutions. This presentation will focus on the emerge of a Java-based security product, which makes the mobile terminal an attractive and accessible security device for any service provider on the internet.
There is a growing demand for cost-effective solutions for secure user authentication. Mobile based user authentication has been around for almost a decade, but has never really been a success due to lack of user friendliness, insufficient security or proprietary solutions. This presentation will focus on the emerge of a Java-based security product, which makes the mobile terminal an attractive and accessible security device for any service provider on the internet. The presentation cover the enCap security product’s Java- and channel architecture, the functions and APIs. Applied technology is Java/JEE on the server side and JME/MIDP on the client side. The use of the new PATS (Program for Advanced Telecom Services)-lab supporting functions will be covered. The PATS-lab is a research agreement between the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) Department of Telematics, Ericsson, Telenor and Hewlett-Packard. The experiences from using the PATS-lab and recent pilot-projects will be presented. Why has this been successful choices and what has been the main challenges, from a development point of view? The presentation will also elaborate on how proper authentication and a secure communication channel can boost mobile applications and services. There will be live demonstrations and possibilities for participation from the audience. Bring your mobile!

MyPage is a central part of the Norwegian governmental strategy to make everyday life simpler for most people by establishing a common gateway for electronic dialogue with the government. According to the “eNorway 2009 – the digital leap” IT strategy roadmap, all new public services should be made accessible through MyPage. By 2007 it should be established an electronically communication channel between citizen and public services as an alternative to the traditional channels. By 2009 all interactive public services should be reachable in MyPage. As a part of the same initiative there is established a common PKI infrastructure, “The Security Portal” which can authenticate all Norwegian citizens based on open standards like Liberty/SAML. This also enables single-sign-on, federation between all service providers sharing this security context.
The MyPage portal is a virtual service office, a web portal for easy access to aggregating all public services accessible on the Internet. It provides an intuitive and easy way to navigate and search for information, and insight into data that the public authorities have registered on each individual citizen. MyPage offers several personalized services for the citizen, and the citizen can themselves choose which service and that are relevant in their personal profile. Among the services offered in MyPage is register, transactional, messaging, calendar. The register service gives the citizen insight into data stored by the public authorities. The transactional service provides a single-sign-on feature across external services and service providers. The messaging service is a two way communication channel between the public authorities and the citizen, exchanging all kind of personal information, documents, schemas etc. The calendar service gives a personal view into all important personal dates between the citizen and the public authorities. MyPage is build on top of a portal framework based on java, and J2EE running on Solaris. The architecture is SOA enabled to easy aggregate new services at runtime. Web Services is used for inter service provider communication and exchange of data. There is ongoing work to support additional types of services like municipality services etc. within MyPage. The number of integrated services and service provider is most likely to increase heavily in the years to come. Required experience: Some knowledge about security, SSO, portals, Web Services, XML, XSL. Expected audience: Some interested in the above, and those who are interested in the development of the Norwegian citizen portal "MinSide", or a generic portal addressing the issues listed above.
Technical architect ( Software-innovation ) I have been the solution and technical architect from the very start of the MyPage project. And I'm still working in the project defining, and designing new versions.

In year 2000 Telenor established a new middleware integration platform for it’s fixed-line service. At present this platform is running over 60 different java enterprise applications developed by teams distributed around the company and the world. The platform integrates with over 50 of Telenor’s back-end systems. To support the developer teams, a centralized platform team has created a common application architecture backed by a standardized development process, tools, guidelines and runtime platform. The name of this platform is Metro and it acts as a distributed middleware factory! In this talk we’ll share our experiences from this process and some secrets from the past 6 years!

Agile principles state that architecture should evolve in an incremental manner, continually adjusting to the requirements at hand. There is no room for Big Design Up Front, the traditional way of designing architecture top-down. So, is there room for an agile architect? This session adresses the role of the architect in agile development projects. As architects in a large project that has introduced agile methods in a previously waterfall-oriented organization, the speakers have struggled with finding the role of architecture in an agile project. It has been a journey from a world where the architect is a godlike superbeing ruling developers with an iron fist to a world where the challenge is finding out how to humbly help the developers do their job. We will talk about the biggest challenges, success stories and experiences - what we did, and what we wish we had done.

In my years as a developer and an architect, I have found that there are many tricks that can boost my productivity and value considerably. Some of these tricks are written down in various books, many are not. The talk aims to give beginners through intermediate developers ideas about how to improve the way they work. The talk covers aspects from writing better code, to writing better emails. The talk will be light and easy, with only an occasional dive into quantum mechanics (or maybe not)
Intro: Are you a coder or a developer? (5 minutes) Thinking better (10 minutes) Asking the right question Effective planning Talking better (10 minutes) Writing better emails and documents Agreement through conflict Coding better (15 minutes) Shortening the feedback loop Idiomatic programming Getting better (10 minutes) How much time to spend learning? When are you done learning?

The main goal of Domain Driven Design (DDD) is to make the system design to reflect and model the reality. However, faced with an already existing system that does not honor this, it might be hard to know where to start. A transition to DDD might then be percevied as a change to make, even considered the values it might add. The technique of domainlogical value-objects is a method for domain-driven programming that stays close to the code. The major advantage is that takes no immediate changes of the structural level of the code, but can be applied with a very small initial effort. In that way, it is possible to very fast start reaping some of the fruits of the domain driven approach, e g more structured in-data validation, more expressive service-APIs and clearer code in the buisiness logic (often EJBs or similar). I this session we present domain-logical value objects, and how you write and use them in practice. The concrete code examples are in Java, but the idéas and techiques can just as well be applied to code written in C++/C, VB or Ruby. The session is based on the speaker´s expericence of improving already-developed code and systems.

Programmer, System Architect and Consultant ( Omegapoint AB ) Dan Bergh Johnsson, programmer, system architect and consultant at Omegapoint AB, Sweden. Since the time as "assisting teacher" at the computing science department at Uppsala University, Dan has propagated for "Code that Mean Something" (as opposed to just doing it). Nowadays, this is reflected as an interest for high-quality system development, with unit-testing, DDD and agile methods as some specialities. Dan is also a recurring speaker at conferences at national and international level, such as Colorado Software Summit and JavaZone (2002 and 2003).

Over the last few years, anyone involved in software development probably (or at least should) have been reminded on numerous occasions of the importance of testing, TDD, test-first, coverage, automated integration testing, etc. It is widely accepted that focus on testing and test driven development increases software quality on many different levels. One could even say that if you don't have a firm grasp of testing, you're probably in the wrong business. However testing often proves more difficult than the standard "bowling pin score card" example would make you believe. Some real life scenarios prove hard and time-consuming to test, and over time tests can prove fragile and cause problems when refactoring or doing even minor changes, especially when the code base grows large. The problems we see are often related to: - External dependencies/extended use of mocking - Tests that rely heavily on resources, environment variables, properties etc. - Unit-testing integrations - Bad, ugly and undocumented test code - Poor test code structure Through real-life examples we aim to demonstrate how and why some of these problems occur, and outline techniques and patterns to help avoid them. This talk will stop hair loss due to pulling your hair out in frustration by showing you how to reap all the test benefits the evangelists have told you about.
Introduction(5 minutes) Intention of talk -What do we want to achieve through testing? Problem/Solution(35 minutes) Show by examples: - Common problems - Why they occur - What they will lead to - How to avoid them Conclusion(10 minutes) Conclude with some basic rules / patterns to follow. –How to achieve through testing. Q&A(10 minutes) Try to get some discussion going. Information Required experience: Some experience with software development and (unit-)testing Expected audience: Everyone. Main benefit will be a better understanding of the importance of test quality, and how to achieve it.

Agile development is a phrase that it appears no buzzword-compliant software development project can be without. However, it is a proper understanding of the motivation and practices, rather than the buzzword conformance, that makes the actual difference in development.
The notion of agility has differing (mis)interpretations and (ab)use. Sometimes it is used as a synonym for Extreme Programming. By contrast, other people use it to mean a generic notion of something that is not quite Extreme Programming, but may borrow ideas from it. Some developers may label a project agile just based on the occasional use of JUnit. Others may use the label to justify not writing any documentation or to avoid agreeing on scope or delivery dates. To be fair, not all uses of the term are cynical or misguided, but the term has lost some of its potency through dilution. This session revisits the motivation for agile development, and goes on to explore the wide-range of perspectives that are encompassed by approaches that can claim to be agile, including both technical and non-technical aspects, in the large and in the small. The six faces of agility presented are the practices, organisation, architecture, tools, skill and attitude. And, like a cube, it is all too easy to focus on a couple of the faces without seeing the rest. Audience: Developers and managers, all levels

Prominent enterprises have lost their competitive advantage due to poor quality development practices. Most enterprises have core, infrastructure, and legacy systems. These core systems are an integral part of most new functionality. These core systems all have similar characteristics: they are fragile, have inadequate testing frameworks, and there are only a few developers left that know how to maintain and enhance them.
How did these core systems get into this condition? The enterprises built this problem into them, release by release. The engineering reasons have been exposed by Agile processes. As releases are built iteratively, each increment makes transparent the underlying quality problems that lead to these design and quality dead core systems. As we have tried to fix these quality problems, the underlying roots in dysfunctional customer-developer relationships that cause the poor quality have been exposed. We will discuss what enterprises can do to fix this quality problem and restore competitive advantage, and how hard it is to do so.

Planning Poker is an agile technique for combining user-story and task estimates of different experts, Empirical research has found that combining the opinions of different experts is a cost-effective way of increasing estimation accuracy. In addition, Planning Poker can ease planning, increase team commitment and reduce the risk of miscommunication. This talk will teach you how Planning Poker works, why it works, and when it does not work. The talk not only explores a technique, but also tries to explain underlying psychological aspects related to the behaviour of groups. Finally, variations you may consider when introducing Planning Poker at your project are discussed, as well as alternatives to Planning Poker.
(5 min) The crowd: mad or wise? (10 min) How does planning poker work? (10 min) Why does planning poker work? (5 min) When does planning poker not work? (5 min) Variations of Planning Poker : (10 min) o Estimating story points vs. ideal days o Fixed vs. flexible estimates o Consensus vs. average Alternatives to planning poker (5 min) Q&A (10 min) Full abstract Empirical research has found that combining the opinions of different experts is a cost-effective way of increasing estimation accuracy. However, the main challenge for software professionals is often when, and how, to combine expert opinion. At what stage in the process? Which experts should be involved? How many experts? How much formalism is sensible to use? Group processes is one of the most studied aspects of psychology, and “The crowd” as groups frequently is called, has both been labelled as mad and hailed as wise in various bestselling books. Group processes have a high relevance for software projects, especially concerning estimating and planning. Regrettably, due to misinterpretation of psychological research, a common misconception in software engineering textbooks has been that groups are “mad”, and that formal procedures are required in group estimation. However, recent research papers and textbooks in software engineering challenge this view, and indicate that a straight-forward combination of expert estimates through group discussion may increase estimation accuracy. Planning Poker is an agile technique for combining user-story and task estimates of different experts. It is an easy to use method that employs a semi-structured group discussion process with minimal formalism and overhead. In our experience, Planning Poker is an effective method for increasing estimation accuracy. It also eases the planning of projects, increases team commitment and reduces the risk for miscommunication. This talk will teach you how Planning Poker works, why it works, and when it does not work. The talk not only explores a technique, but also tries to explain underlying psychological aspects related to the behaviour of groups. Finally, variations you may consider when introducing Planning Poker at your project are discussed, as well as alternatives to Planning Poker. Required experience: Participants should have experience with estimating software tasks, but as the talk has a mainly psychological perspective, it is equally suited for all levels of software expertise. Expected audience: Developers, Project Managers, Project owners, Business strategists and Process Improvement Specialist

Lean thinking has had a dramatic effect on industries from manufacturing to banking to hospitals. In software development, lean principles lead us inevitably to agile software development – and beyond. Lean is not just about iterative development, it is about transforming customer needs into deployed software rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly. Lean is not about slowing down and being careful, it’s about catching errors the moment they occur so that you can reliably go fast. And finally, lean is about taking a look at the amount of work you have piled up in lists and queues – with an eye to getting rid of the queues entirely. This presentation deals with aspects of lean that you might not have thought about while implementing agile software development practices. It will challenge development teams to think differently about the way they approach their work.
Principles of Lean Just-in-Time – What does this mean in software development? Stop-the-Line – How does this actually work? Whole Team, Complete Product What is a value stream? What is a team? Go Fast Why Quality, Speed, and Low Cost go together How Queuing Theory works in software development

Business owners across the world are investing more and more in Business Intelligence (BI) solutions. It is the #1 or #2 IT spending priority in many companies. Business Intelligence realizes the promise of IT: that information systems will help businesses run better. This presentation is designed for technologists and technology managers who wish to learn more about the role of BI within an IT department, what the different components of an abstraction architecture consist of, and what open source technologies can be used to implement these components. The architecture is explained using a case study based on the need for regional hospital systems to: Realize emerging trends and patterns dynamically within and cross hospital systems Establish and evaluate trending thresholds Proactively notify appropriate resources when thresholds are crossed Provide data and information for advanced ad-hoc analysis Integrate multiple, disparate source systems with minimal coding or overhead Provide for "Enterprise transactions" that exist beyond a single transactional system This case study is based on a system designed by the author for the Vanderbilt University Medical Center to track SARS and Avian Flu pandemics.

Traditional requirements written as text documents - such as use cases or requirement specifications - is an inefficient way to communicate functionality. Each developer has to interpret the text, details are omitted and the descriptions are frequently not maintained and kept up to date. These documents are essentially redundant; they mirror the executable application and the tests, and you have to keep tests, requirements and the application in sync manually. Example-Driven, executable specifications offers a more flexible and effective alternative by using User Stories and Fit tables to bring requirements and tests together in a document that both specify the desired behaviour of the application, and can be executed at any time to assess whether a feature is implemented and working. This BOF session provides a walkthrough of the process of writing and maintaining executable specifications, using tools such as FIT and FitNesse. We will also look briefly at WebUI specifications with tools such as Watir and Selenium. The session will be open to a large degree of questions and interaction from the audience. The speakers have been using these techniques on projects for the past 2-3 years, and will give concrete advice using real-life scenarios.

How do you really set-up and run an agile project? At Amazon.com you can by hundreds of books focusing on agile software development in one way or another. You can attend seminars and conferences home or abroad. This is a great way to get a theoretical foundation, but once you get started, practical challenges and questions start popping up. This session provides insight in how agile software development principles were applied to a 6 month project involving a 10 person development team. The objective is to leave you with practical solutions you can apply to your own project tomorrow, with regards to planning and tracking releases and iterations as well as continuously improving the process. Simplicity and visibility is the key. Plain tools like index-cards, whiteboards and a huge LCD screen can give the team and other stakeholders total control at any time.

There are many aspects of testing web applications that makes it far from enjoyable to say the least. In this session we will present and demonstrate CubicTest, an open source Eclipse plugin that tries to make web tests easier to write, maintain and run for technical as well as non-technical users. CubicTest uses a graphical user interface to let users model tests instead of writing test scripts. The tool focuses on enabling test driven development of web applications, but also supports testing of existing web applications. The goal is to make it possible to replace a detailed requirements specification and manual test scripts with tests written in CubicTest. There are features in CubicTest that makes it quite unique. It has support for testing with a set of changing parameters and to use internationalization to run the same test against the same web site with different input parameters and languages. CubicTest can create a mock-up (HTML skeleton) of the modeled web application based on the tests, with e.g. forms and site navigation present. CubicTest also has an intuitive way to model tests for sites using Ajax technology. Hierarchical test composition is also supported to make it possible to hide test details behind abstractions, which makes it easier to read and write larger test sets. Tests can be exported to other test frameworks (e.g. Watir and the CubicUnit test framework). CubicTest is an open source project at http://cubictest.sourceforge.net and distributed under the GNU General Public License v.2. The tool is still under development, but a 1.0 release is planned for Q3 2006.

GlassFish is a recent and active open source community which has delivered a production-ready Java EE 5 compliant application server in May 2006. Although missing clustering capabilities, this first version is used in production by several demanding web sites and applications. Grizzly (nio web framework), web services, documentation, administration, and monitoring tools are some of its key features. Also, full Java EE 5 support means you can use features such EJB 3 and JPA (Java Persistence API), the new JAX-WS 2.x Web Services stack and JSF (JavaServer Faces) 1.2 MVC framework. This session will focus on Version 2 of GlassFish (due to be released in the Fall of 2007) and will cover clustering, OpenESB (a JBI implementation) integration and the new Web Services stack called Metro (JAX-WS and WSIT, aka "project Tango" combined) for secure, transactionnal, asynchonous, and reliable Web Services. Performance and ease-of-use features are also key features in this release. Some of these features will be demoed during the talk including IDE integration. Open Source clearly isn't about good enough and the GlassFish community believes that there's still plenty of room for innovation at the application server level. So this session provides technical details on the preview of GlassFish v3 (modular HK2 architecture, startup time). Finally, the presentation will touch on the GlassFish community from users to partners.
This is a 1-hour technical overview for a developer audience which includes /several short but live demonstrations/.

This talk will consider some challenges when implementing a high performance, server application in Java and our responses to them. While implementing the application in Java 5, we have found three major areas where libraries/JVM provided insufficient support. First: Thread control – how to make sure you application maintains control of those threads. Second – Interrupts, how to deal with them. Third: Garbage collection – how will it behave in production? We will give a compact introduction to each of the challenges before detailing our response to them. Hopefully you may be able to learn from our actions.
( Fast Search & Transfer ASA ) I work at Fast Search & Transfer ASA, where I have been employed since I completed my master in computer science at NUST (NTNU) in the complex computer systems group in 2005. Programming has been my hobby since the early 90s and I’m starting to get a grip on what it means. Recent experiences have taught me not to do multi-threaded programming. Unless really necessary. And necessary it is, so here I am doing it :)

Garbage collection is an invisible but extremely helpful part of the Java language. Investing a bit of effort in understanding garbage collection can yield big benefits in terms of application throughput and responsiveness, but care must be taken. It is common to try and improve application responsiveness by tuning the garbage collector to shorten garbage collection pauses. However, short pauses alone do not guarantee good application response times. Judging whether an application is performing well or poorly on the basis of pause times alone is dangerous, because big pause times often go along with great application performance. Even the total amount of time spent paused for garbage collection is not a good predictor of the impact of garbage collection on application performance. Although garbage collection is often treated as a performance cost, garbage collection can actually outperform manual memory management. Verbose garbage collection logs contain lots of information but it's not always obvious what it means or how to use it. Verbose gc can guide gc tuning decisions and also give insight into application behaviour. Verbose gc can help diagnose application response time problems, detect memory leaks and spotlight pathological patterns of object creation. I will demonstrate using verbose gc analysis tools to quickly find memory leaks, choose the best heap size, and choose the garbage collection policy which makes an application go fastest.
Tooling developer ( IBM ) Holly is a tooling developer within the IBM Java Technology Centre. She develops garbage collection analysis tools, building on her experience working as a performance engineer within the garbage collection development team. Holly has been with IBM for five years. Before joining IBM she completed a doctorate in quantum computation at the University of Oxford.

Java integrated development environments (IDEs) have offered unparalleled productivity tools for developers. Refactoring, code completion, and static code analysis are all made possible by the Java programming language's static typing system. Dynamic languages, on the other hand, have traditionally left much to be desired in the tools department. Their proponents have argued that tools are not as necessary, because there is less code to write, and that unit tests can replace static checking. With dynamic languages such as Ruby being hosted on the Java platform, new efforts have been made to bring the features of Java IDEs to the dynamic language world. The results are promising: as a dynamic language developer, you can have your cake and eat it too. This technical session covers recent developments for Ruby in the NetBeans IDE and discusses future directions for research in this area, such as direct and statistical type inference, wide-ranging refactoring support, more-accurate code completion, and multilanguage editing and debugging.
Software Engineer ( Sun ) Tor Norbye is a senior staff engineer at Sun Microsystems where he is working on Ruby support for NetBeans.

In this session we intend to demonstrate to the audience, using source code examples and live demos, how it is possible to develop rich, snappy, native-looking, desktop applications using the framework Qt Jambi. Qt Jambi is the Java version of the popular Qt C++ cross-platform framework, opening a world of possibilities for Java and C++ programmers alike. It is an officially supported technology aimed at Java programmers who want to create great-looking GUI applications using a first-rate GUI framework. The Qt C++ framework has been at the heart of commercial applications since 1995. Qt is used by companies and organizations as diverse as Adobe®, Boeing®, IBM®, Motorola®, NASA, Skype®, and by numerous smaller companies and organizations. Qt's classes are fully featured and provide consistent interfaces to assist learning, reduce developer workload, and increase programmer productivity. Qt also has a long history in the Open Source community, among other things as the foundation of the K Desktop Environment (KDE). In our presentation we will demonstrate Qt Designer by example and at the same time introduce Qt Jambi's signal and slot mechanism, layout management, and Qt Jambi's ability to customize user interface look using cascading stylesheets (CSS). We will also demonstrate some of basic of Qt's model view framework. Qt Designer is a WYSIWYG tool for graphically designing user interfaces. Qt Designer can be used purely for GUI design, or to create entire applications with its support for integration with popular integrated development environments (IDEs), like Eclipse. Using Qt Designer for our examples, we will see how Qt Jambi's layout management and signals and slots works. Signals and Slots are Qt Jambi's object communication mechanism, gluing components together in a simpler manner than traditional listener interfaces. Attendees to this presentation are expected to gain insight a new way of developing desktop applications using Java. Expected requirements from the audience is a basic knowledge of the Java Programming Language and GUI development.

Java background: In addition to his experience from leading the Qt Jambi development, he worked as a professional java developer for several years.

The talk is about how an ESB, and Mule in particular, can be utilized to create Mashups. Mashups and ESBs serve as catalysts for learning new technologies and thus stay in touch with the latest buzzwords (if that it a personal goal). The notion of Mashups fuels creative ideas and an ESB like Mule makes it easy to realize them. This talk promotes the idea that Mashups and Mule is a perfect match for learning the new techonologies. GeoMail is used throughout the talk and serves as an example that illustrates the road from an idea to a final Mashup. GeoMail retrieves the IP address of the originating sender of your incoming e-mails, resolves a geographic location from that IP-address using a public Web Service and plots the locations asynchrounously om GoogleMaps using a custom Mule Ajax Transport. The result is a live view of how widespread your mailinglist is or how international your contact list is. This talk will present how GeoMail is created and the choices that were made in order to stay buzzword-compliant.

Have you ever struggled to figure out why some part of your application runs slowly? Have you ever seen hard-to-reproduce OutOfMemoryErrors that shut down your application? What do you need to make profiling of a Java application easy? The answer is simple: powerful tools that are well integrated into your development environment. Recent advances in the JDK software have increased the power and flexibility of profiling tools for the Java platform. Further advances in integrated development environments (IDEs) have made profiling tools even easier and more convenient to use. Finding performance problems, threading issues, and memory leaks has never been easier. This session focuses on specific advances in the integration of powerful profiling tools into the NetBeans IDE and includes demonstrations that show specific use cases.
Outline 1. What sorts of problems can an integrated profiler help you solve? 2. The state of the art today: NetBeans Profiler version 5.5.1 3. Case Study: A memory leak in HttpUnit. 4. Upcoming enhancements to make things even easier: A preview of NetBeans Profiler 6.0. 5. Case Study: JRoller performance problems.

OSGi is a mature and powerful dynamic module system for Java which recently has gained a lot of interest in the Java community. OSGi offers real modularization within a Java Virtual Machine, including dynamic updates of modules (or “bundles” in OSGi jargon), as well as a service oriented API for communication between the modules. A well known example of a rich client application based on OSGi is the Eclipse IDE. The Spring-OSGi project aims to make it easy to build Spring applications that run in an OSGi framework. Spring-OSGi achieves this by letting services, used for inter-bundle communication, be exported and referenced with methods familiar to Spring developers. This talk gives a brief introduction to OSGi and then continues on to show how Spring-OSGi may be used in order to modularize a rich client application written in Swing. The talk will include lessons learned from OSGi development, and solutions to problems typically encountered. The presentation will also show some practical steps you will need to go through in order to start using Spring-OSGi.
- Introduction to OSGi and Spring-OSGi (10 minutes) - Modularizing a Swing application using Spring-OSGi (30 minutes) - Lessons learned (10 minutes) - Q & A (10 minutes) Required Experience: Knowledge of J2SE, class loaders, Swing, the Spring container Expected Audience: Anyone considering OSGi as a platform for rich client development. Attendees will learn what OSGi is and how it may be applied in such a scenario.

There is a common misconception among many end-users, consumers, and developers that Ajax is the ultimate solution for the Web, and that it can provide all the same functionality as a rich desktop solution. Sure, Ajax can cover most of our expectations for a rich client, mimicking functionality provided by a desktop application, but there is still one area that has yet to be fully integrated - scalable server-initiated message delivery - Enterprise Comet. Comet is an advanced technique to enable real-time messaging from a Web server to one or more browsers, even if some of those browsers are behind a firewall or proxy server. Imagine being able to monitor any real-time data source from server statistics to your favorite stock portfolio, directly from your Web browser with no polling, no plugins and no pain! Grizzly enhances the Glassfish project with Comet support via Asynchronous Request Processing (ARP), addressing any server-side scalability concerns with Comet. The Dojo organization provides the Bayeux Protocol, used to coordinate shared access to the Comet notification channel coming from the server.
In this talk the presenters will discuss scalability, security, and performance implementing support for Enterprise Comet using GWT, Bayeux, Comet, and Grizzly.

The topic of this presentation is about innovative use of AOP in open-source Java grid computing framework that is trying to change the grid computing landscape in much the same way as Spring or JBoss have changed JEE landscape in the last couple of year – removing complexity, clutter and over-engineering of traditional computational grid solutions. The presentation will concentrate around live demonstration of writing a simple application like a HelloWorld and grid enabling it to run on a small grid right in front of the audience and with audience participation. Demonstration will be performed on Windows XP using Eclipse 3.2, Java 5 and GridGain framework (LGPL open-source Java grid computing framework available at www.gridgain.org). CDs will be made available before and during presentation for anybody who would like to become a part of ad-hoc grid during demonstration (simple 1-minute installation for Windows XP/Vista or Linux is required). All coding during demonstration will be done live. Detailed and in-depth explanations will highlight that grid computing in Java can be fun, simple and productive to use in everyday applications and systems. Special attention will be paid to the fact that grid computing can be used by businesses of any size: small, medium or large. Real-life examples will be discussed. Technical content of the presentation will focus on how AOP is used in this example to achieve transparent grid-enabling or grid-enabling without even touching a source code. It will also discuss during live demonstration some of the innovative features of GridGain such as peer-to-peer deployment and hot re-deployment, resource injection, unique support for split/aggregation and Spring/JBoss integration.
It’s important to note that 1/2 (30 minutes) of the entire presentation will be devoted to a live coding demonstration and slides only support introduction and conclusion parts of the presentation. Introduction o Nikita Ivanov o GridGain, www.gridgain.org o Live demonstration Why is Grid Computing? o Grid computing o Huge potential o However, compute grids today are o Leading to Why Java?

Java SE 6 now has over four hundred command line options that can be specified for the Sun JVM. Understanding what these options are and how they affect the performance of an application is a daunting prospect. This session will look at the major areas of tuning for the Sun JVM: garbage collection, thread synchronisation and bytecode interpretation. We'll look at how the JVM works internally, and the affect that changing various parameters can have on the JVM and, consequently how this will impact your applications performance. We'll also briefly look at freely available tools that can be used to monitor and profile an application giving you greater insight into the things that can be changed to improve performance.

Generics are the largest and most important change to the Java programming language since it was introduced. Although the fundamentals of generics are easy to absorb, misunderstandings persist and common use-cases are not well understood. For example, what is “migration compatibility,” and why is it central to the design of generics? What strategies do you have for migrating an existing library? What pitfalls need to be avoided when combining generics and arrays? What do wildcards really represent, and how should you use them? This session will use the ideas underlying generics to answer these and other common questions.
• Motivation for generics (5) o Cleaner code, stronger compile-time typing, more expressive interfaces Benefits of implementation by erasure: migration compatibility (15) o Migration strategies: surface generification, stubs, wrappers Problems with erasure (15) o Array typing vs generic typing, converting a collection to an array o Principle of Truth in Advertising , Principle of Indecent Exposure Wildcard types: what they are and how to use them (10) What next for generics? (5) Experience: Participants should be familiar with the basic ideas of generics Audience: Practising programmers working or soon to work with Java 5 or Java 6

One of the design patterns of SOA is to move control flow to an orchestration component which connects multiple reusable services into a composite application. The result in practice is that these orchestrations, often bpel processes, tend to be a mixture of business services which offer well-defined business value, and technical services which offer technical capabilities which are always required in IT solutions – for instance authorisation, logging, etc. What is required is an aspect-oriented approach where these technical services can be injected into a composite application. This allows a business process to concentrate on business functionality, remain understandable to business analysts, and most importantly, allow different aspects to be injected within a business process thereby removing the need need to have multiple versions of the same process depending on the governance contract it is expected to meet. This talk discusses and demonstrates how an aspect-oriented approach can be implemented for composite applications which are developed and deployed to OpenESB. OpenESB is an open source, ESB implementation based on the Java Business Integration (JBI) standard. It will show two design patterns for injecting patterns into composite applications. The Facade pattern allows the user to apply a chain of aspects that serve as a façade to a deployed provisioning service. The Weaving pattern allows the user to weave an existing application with chains of aspects between services within a Composite Application. OpenESB supports different types of aspects: - Technical aspects. For instance, authentication, authorisation, and caching. - Aspects which enforce enterprise integration patterns. For instance, scatter-gatherer, queueing, auto-reconnect, and prioritisaton. - Business aspects. For instance, chargeback, audit trail, and lease management. Finally the presentation looks at how version 2.0 of JBI will include standards support for service invocation interception and policy enforcement for improve aspect orientation
- SOA and Composite Applications: - Patterns for injecting aspects into a Composite Application - Aspects that can be injected into composite applications - Demo + Show how to implement Caching, Data Transformations using the Gateway approach + Show how to implement Caching, Data Transformations using the Weaving approach. - Improvements to version 2.0 of the Java -Business Integration standard for supporting Aspect-Oriented Composite Applications - Summary

Web service developers have generally been limited to two different development models, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The "code-first" model provides a familiar environment and a flexible development process, but has historically suffered from impaired interoperability. The "contract-first" development model allows for elevated interoperability, but at the cost of a high entry barrier, a steep learning curve, and a heavy development process. In an effort to leverage the best of both worlds, Web service developers are increasingly adopting a "code-first, contract-aware" approach. The proposed presentation will attempt to sort out the complex issues that surface when establishing a flexible, reliable development model for interoperable Web services. The Enunciate project will be introduced as a possible solution to contract-aware Web service development. A concrete demonstration of contract-aware Web service development will be provided using Enunciate. A rich set of services and domain objects will be published as a fully-documented, interoperable web application that exposes its service endpoints via SOAP, REST-XML, and JSON. Client code for multiple platforms will also be generated and exercised to demonstrate the powerful interoperability features of the deployed application. The application will be much more than a simple "Hello, World" service, sporting complex objects, one-way operations, and MTOM binary attachments.

The benefits of automated testing are many, and a lot of programmers and teams are doing test-driven development and extensive automated testing. Yet many struggle with maintaining their test suite, and end up in situations where every little change to the code breaks some tests. Often it is not clear why the change causes the tests to break, thus requiring the programmers to spend an annoying amount of time working out whether the tests are failing for a good reason or not. This talk looks into the issue by identifying a number of test smells that contribute to this problem, and suggests some patterns and strategies that will improve the current state of practise.

This follow-on to last year's JavaOne sleeper hit "The Top 10 Ways to Botch an Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application" explores best practices for protecting against scalability and reliability in Java Enterprise Edition applications and compute grid environments. Starting with simple abuses of messaging and clustering technologies, this presentation navigates a wide swath of options available to enterprising architects seeking to limit the effectiveness of scale-out environments. After last year's presentation, we were disappointed that some attendees mistakenly used this information to avoid pitfalls, errors, and other common causes of project failure. We hope for better results this year.

Traditional Spring-based architectures focus on the notion of a central service layer, with the communication between the services designed as synchronous method invocations. Spring 2.0 introduced extensive support for "Message-Driven Objects" and general asynchronous task execution, allowing the use of messaging and concurrent execution within the heart of a Spring-based application. This talk provides a tour through the messaging and concurrency facilities that Spring offers, including Spring 2.1's JMS configuration namespace and JCA 1.5 support.
Message-Oriented Architectures: messaging versus asynchronous task execution (10 min) Synchronous JMS Messaging in Spring: JMS setup examples, JmsTemplate usage (15 min) Asynchronous JMS Messaging in Spring: message listener container examples (20 min) Spring's TaskExecutor abstraction and other related Spring facilities (10 min) Expected audience: People with an interest in Spring as well as messaging, ideally familiar with the JMS API basics as well as the Spring fundamentals. Attendees will learn about the sophisticated functionality that Spring offers in the JMS space, as well as about the general use of asynchronous execution within Spring-based application architectures.

The Java Persistence API (JPA) is fast becoming the popular choice for object-relational persistence not only in Java EE environments but also in enterprise applications that make use of other technologies, such as Spring. Since the JPA standard has taken hold, the developer base has gotten more experienced with the persistence model, and the questions that arise are now more of an intermediate or advanced nature. In this talk we will introduce a few of the common features and use them as a platform on which we can discuss some of the higher order JPA topics. As part of this discussion we will show how to use multiple persistence units, define and tune identifier generators, create and invoke native queries, and use XML mapping files for overriding annotation metadata. We will also show how JPA can be used in Java SE and Spring environments. While attendees that have some experience using JPA will profit from this talk, even those who are interested in JPA, but who have not yet started writing applications with it, could also enjoy it. Some kind of experience with Java persistence would be beneficial, though.

One of the most popular features of languages such as Smalltalk, ObjectiveC, and Ruby is duck typing. The basic thought behind duck typing is that if an object walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then the language is happy to treat it as if it a duck. In other words: the object’s type is determined by what it can do, not by its class. Web services exchange information, often in a common, interlingual format such as XML. What happens when we apply the principles behind duck typing to Web services? This talk presents WS-DuckTyping: not a new W3C standard; but rather a way to deal with XML as if it were a duck. We will give a number of practical tips to implement this Anatidaeic development style, including working with XPath to extract information from incoming Web service request, whether and how to validate XML with a schema, and more. Finally, we will show some recent improvements into Spring Web Services which facilitate WS-DuckTyping.

Recently we have encountered questions such as "How do I invoke a method" in the context of dependency injection frameworks. The more difficult questions, like "how to invoke invoke a static method" has become senior developer material. The reason is of course that we are now using a ProxyFactoryBean from an XML configuration file, and not Java. The most popular tool for wiring is the Spring Framework, and it will be used in all examples. Wiring applications together using Spring may end up in a set of difficult-to-understand configuration files. There seems to be a belief among most developers that wiring of an application and the use of XML goes hand in hand, and that it is something not possible using pure Java. The speakers will present a Web project consisting of multiple dependencies, where Maven is used to help manage the dependencies. Two parallel approaches will be compared and shown using examples: One using Spring and XML, and one using pure java without a framework. We will compare the two approaches and recommend how wiring together applications using Java can be done, and may lead to a set of other nice effects as well, both in terms of testability, refactoring, and improved roundtrip time. How did we end up here?

One of the key outcomes of the work on EJB 3.0 was the introduction of the Java Persistence API - a new, simplified API for POJO persistence and object/relational mapping for use both in Java EE and in Java SE environments. While the Java Persistence API has received considerable attention since its initial release, it is still missing a number of features that are available in implementations today and that have been requested by the community for inclusion in the Java Persistence standard. The purpose of Java Persistence 2.0 is to augment the Java Persistence API to further address the needs of the community, by expanding its object/relational mapping and query language capabilities, correcting areas that lead to lack of portability, standardizing features that are currently designated as optional or are underspecified, and improving integration with other Java EE platform technologies.
This talk will discuss work in progress on Java Persistence 2.0, currently under development through the Java Community Process program: what our goals are and why; what we have accomplished so far; and what we still need to do.
Senior architect ( Sun Microsystems ) Linda DeMichiel is a senior architect in the Java EE Platform group at Sun Microsystems and specification lead for Java Persistence 2.0. As the former specification lead of Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 she was responsible for driving the radical simplification of the EJB programming model, and was recognized as the 2006 Java Community Process Outstanding Spec Lead for Java SE/EE for her leadership in this work. Linda has over 20 years of experience in the areas of databases, object persistence, and distributed computing. Before assuming responsibility for EJB, she led the team that implemented Sun's first object/relational persistence product, and worked earlier at IBM on object/relational extensions to both DB2 and the SQL99 standard. She holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University.

Structuring a large code base maintained by multiple teams working in parallel can be a real challenge. If you are not disciplined about code structure overtime you will end up with a tangled, unmaintainable mess that cannot adapt to change and risks ossifying into legacy. In this session Juergen and Arjen will pull from their experiences working on large projects to provide important guidelines on code structure. In this session we will pull from their experiences working on large projects (including the Spring Framework) to provide general guidelines on: - Packaging and package interdependencies - Layering and module decomposition - Evolving a large code base We will also discuss how tools can play a role in enforcing architectural soundness. Attendees will leave with practical techniques to improve and sustain the overall structure of their code bases, as well as an understanding of the benefits gained by doing so.
After a short introduction and agenda, we go into code organization. We will explain why code organization is important, but also see that it is often ignored. Next, we will talk about package interdependencies, and show typical examples of code bases that get this wrong. This section will take approximately 10 minutes. Then, we go one step up in granularity, and we talk about module decomposition. We discuss the properties of a module, and talk about the subtle difference between layering and modules. This section will also take about 10 minutes. Then we will look into the Spring framework. We will talk about the evolution of Spring, and the challenges that were tackled when Spring 2.0 was released. This will take about 15 minutes. We will also look at some tools which help you managing such a large code base. We will show these tools in a demo. This will take about 15 minutes. Finally, we offer a summary, and have about 10 minutes left for Q&A. Required experience: Basic knowledge of basic code quality measures is useful Expected audience: Developers working on larger code bases

SOA is widely adopted for easy integration, development flexibility and leverage, and business agility. However, the inherent complexities and overheads in today's common SOA platforms make the running of stateful business-critical applications seem impossible. In this session, we will demonstrate that SOA ceases to be an oxymoron to high performance when exploiting simple and open, yet powerful technologies such as Spring and Space Based Architecture as the SOA execution environment. We will outline a clear path for turning existing applications into linearly scalable architectures that scale on-demand across a pool of machines, while discussing issues such as loose versus tight coupling, event driven messaging, synchronization, SLAs and high availability, and migration of legacy applications.
Expected audience: Developers

Apache Tuscany provides an open-source services infrastructure for constructing SOA solutions from heterogeneous and distributed services. To make the implementation and deployment of services straightforward Apache Tuscany is based on the widely supported Service Component Architecture (SCA) specification currently being standardized at OASIS. With the Tuscany implementation of SCA, application developers can easily create, reuse and customize services in different languages, for example, Java, BPEL or various scripting languages, and then assemble and deploy them in a distributed environment. Through slides and examples this talk will introduce SCA and the Apache Tuscany project. It will show you how to get started building and connecting services and how this approach simplifies the task of building SOA solutions.

The key to any successful performance tuning exercise is in getting a measurement that offers the insight needed to understand the root cause of poor performance. Yet for many teams that measurement proves to be very elusive. Lacking any real evidence teams often resort to guessing at what the problem is. Although teams can successfully at guessing it is rarely an effective means to direct a tuning effort. In this seminar we will explore some of the reasons why teams fail to obtain that all revealing measurement. The session will introduce a conceptual tool that can be used to more effectively tackle performance problems. At the end of the day measuring is about tooling and so we will explore some tools that have been useful in exposing root causes of performance troubles.

In contrast to general programming languages like Java, a Domain Specific Language is a programming language that is target towards a particular kind of problem. Even if DSLs have been around in various forms for ages, the rising popularity of dynamic languages has made them a hot topic again. Most of the attention has been on how one can use these dynamic languages constructs to craft embedded DSLs. Unfortunately, most developers cannot use Ruby or Groovy in their everyday work and the advantage a DSL has to offer remains a theoretical possibility. This talk will introduce you to a variety of design philosophies, design patterns and programming techniques you can use to define embedded DSLs using nothing but plain old Java. After attending this talk you should be able to use your Java skills to extend” the language to enable you to write code that reads like plain English.
A brief introduction to Domain Specific Languages Design philosophies o What makes Ruby “elegant”? o Humane Interfaces Designing DSLs in Java (Patterns & Practices) o The Builder pattern - How the builder pattern simplifies object model assembly. - Using Java 1.5 static imports to extend the Java vocabulary. - Demo: “Skipping two versions” – Language level XML support in Java 1.5 (See http://andersnoras.com/blogs/anoras/archive/2007/04/25/xml-dsl-for-java-1-5.aspx for an example) - Demo: Building a DSL for XHTML Documents. o The Fluent Interface pattern - Creating expressive APIs that read like plain English using the fluent interface pattern. - “LINQ for J” - Extending Java with a query language. (See http://andersnoras.com/blogs/anoras/archive/2 007/03/23/guess-what-i-m-up-to.aspx for an example.) - Demo: Adding query capabilities for any Iterable resource. - Demo: Extending Hibernate to support the query DSL. “There is more to Java than Java” - Using the Java 1.6 scripting features to create dynamic DSLs.

Those involved in software have a lot to keep in mind as they negotiate the worlds inside and outside of their code and the relationship between them. For those interested in improving the state of their art there are many (many) sources of specific recommendations they can use to sharpen their practice.
This talk takes a step back from the busy, overpopulated and often overwhelming world of such recommendations to focus on five general considerations that can inform more detailed recommendations and specific decisions.

There is a big buzz and a lot of hype about Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). A solid SOA architecture allows you to use standards-based, pluggable, and loosely coupled services to integrate and communicate the critical business logic from disparate systems. Apache Service Mix is one of the first ESB implementations in open source to offer a solid foundation for building SOA applications. This session will cover Apache ServiceMix and how it implements Java Business Integration (JBI - JSR208) covering Service Engines (SE), Binding Components (BC), and how the different components communicate via the Normalized Messaging Router (NMR). It will also demonstrate coding and wiring these components together to show how to begin building a SOA based application with a real world example.

The Java platform comes with plenty of tools to ease software development. Since version 6, the JDK now includes Java DB, a 100% Java powered database. Leveraging the ease of use of the Java Persistence API, now also available in a Java SE environment, developers can easily take advantage of the power of these systems in their desktop applications. During this presentation we will cover what is needed to integrate these tools within a Swing application and demonstrate the benefits in term of speed and features both technologies can bring to your desktop software at almost no cost. Besides persisting your domain model, you'll also see how to persist your application state, enabling instant recovery from expected as well as unexpected terminations. Finally, beyond the desktop local data, we'll introduce remoting, synchronizing data with a remote Java EE application: on top of synchronizing modified data on both ends, it also export new instances to each database.

Deploying Maven in large organizations is not an easy task. Primarily it requires a change in mindset on how to create and maintain your software codebase over time. In order to successfully introduce Maven it is important to setup the necessary infrastructure components correctly. This includes the installation of Maven, a company internal artifact repository, establishing project object models and continuous integration, integrated with the company source control system. Also an internal Maven Proxy should be set up, in order to build on top of external repositories if this behaviour is desired. The presentation takes a practical approach to establishing all the required infrastructure components based on best practices and real-life project experience within large enterprise projects. I will address common challenges when deploying Maven and related products. Maven requires a somewhat different mindset than traditional solutions, like using Ant for purposes of build and committing binary artifacts to version control. Traditionally, many companies have invested lots of time into developing their own build scripts on a per project basis and these are very rarely reused. With Maven, the approach is different - the idea is to deploy a company-wide infrastructure which should be reused by all projects. Also, when reusing in a large enterprise context, the advantage of common rules for placing source code and configuration files are truly helpful as they secure an enterprise-wide point of standardization. Internal frameworks are much easier to reuse than before by continuously deploying company internal snapshots thus making them available for clients. Also, automation of code metrics and different types of reports are easy to publish. Other challenges one typically faces, of which will be addressed as part of the presentation are: - Implicit plugin versioning often causes problems. Without explicitly setting versions, the latest/greatest snapshot will always be downloaded and the quality of those can vary. - Many third party frameworks are distributed with poor dependency definitions, causing many unnecessary artifacts to be downloaded and deployed through transitive dependencies. - From time to time, people make mistakes like redeploying new versions of artifacts based on existing versions. This will cause clients to never download the new versions of those artifacts. - When introducing many frameworks at the same time, one risk that several artifacts have dependencies to different versions of the same artifacts and this can cause some difficult to solve side-effects in the runtime. - Many companies carry legacy build solutions and it is possible to integrate those with Maven. However, a mix of Ant, Maven1 and Maven2 is never a good idea in real-life.
Why Maven is useful in an enterprise context beyond building and developing standalone applications. Establishing an enterprise-wide artifact repository based on available open source products, like Maven proxies. Configuring the project object model to integrate the repository and source control. Establishing continous integration with Continuum. Q&A

After fighting complexity in configuration management, packaging, bureaucracy and deployment with Java EE servers for longer than we thought was humanly possibly, my team finally decided to go back to basics. Instead of a complex Java EE application server, we have put together a 100% open source application stack that runs in a standard Java SE environment, and addresses the development life cycle from programming and unit testing into production and operations. The solution has given us simplicity and control over the whole life cycle from development and unit testing, through continuous integration, packaging and configuration management, into staging and production environments. The presentation will focus around a practical demonstration of this life cycle. Our new solution, internally dubbed "the Java SE server", is a custom-built assembly of stable and widely used open source components like Maven, Jetty, Spring and Hibernate running on a standard Java VM. We are currently in the process of rolling out the solution on four systems, three of which are business critical, and more will follow. (Some roll-outs will be before JavaZone, some after)

Besides the wide variety of open source tools and frameworks for application development, the support for open source enterprise integration is growing fast. This presentation will provide the attendees with a selection of Open source Enterprise Integration tools and frameworks and will show these tools and frameworks with demos. The foundation of this presentation will be based on Mule. This Open source integration platform shows that implementing an ESB doesn't have to be complex and expensive. A more lightweight approach can be very benificiary in a lot of cases. To show that Mule can be used in enterprise integration scenarios, a number of the Enterprise Integration Patterns of Hohpe and Woolf are implemented. By using these patterns we can show the attendees a structured approach from designing an integration solution to the real implementation of the solution.
Goal of this presentation (overview of open source enterprise integration, structured approach from design to implementation) 3 min Overview of Mule (Mule history, architecture and UMO components) 5 min Hello world demo with Mule (Show the open source tools and frameworks) 10 min Case study (show a simple case study) 2 min In action demo (coding the solution during the presentation) building up the case study in parts (30 min) Start with a simple message channel (point-to-point and pub-sub) Show content enricher, canonical data model and message transformation with integration of NASA Map Show content-based routing with integration of Flicker

As web sites transition from simple content to full-blown, two-way applications the legacy cruft of the past ten years is becoming apparent. There are millions of sites and billions of pages that have been around since the 1990s. Many of these pages were designed for browsers like Netscape 3, Internet Explorer 2, or even Mosaic. They may have been redesigned several times, but the underlying structure and markup remains the same; and this is becoming a problem. These pages don’t work well with modern technologies and tools like AJAX, DOM, E4X, JavaScript, and more. Consequently, many web developers and designers find themselves faced with legacy code for the first time. Until recently most sites and pages just weren’t old enough for legacy issues to be a major concern. While legacy issues and the tools and techniques for managing them are well known to programmers, web folks are just now learning about these problems. As web designers begin to grapple with the legacy issues that have hampered programmers for so long, they’ll need to learn the same refactoring techniques programmers have used to manage these problems.
This talk help web designers, web authors, web programmers, and webmasters learn the tools and skills they need to clean up their sites so they can take them to the next level. Specific goals include improving accessibility and usability, optimizing search engine placement, and reducing the overall cost of development for web sites. by converting sites to web standards: XHTML, CSS, and REST.

One of the most difficult things to do (in Java web development) today is pick which web framework to use when development an application. The Apache Software foundation hosts most of the popular Java web frameworks: Struts, MyFaces, Tapestry and Wicket. This session will compare these different web frameworks, as well as Spring MVC and Stripes. It will briefly explain how each works and the strengths and weaknesses of each. Tips, tricks and gotcha's will be plentiful. Lastly, it will provide attendees with a sample application that utilizes all 6 frameworks, so they can compare line-by-line how the frameworks are different. This sample application will include the following features: sortable/pageable list, client and server-side validation, success and error messages as well as some Ajax functionality. The frameworks will be rated on how easy they make it to implement these features.

You can also import Java class files, create new objects for the Java platform, call their methods, and implement interfaces for the Java platform. IDE plug-ins are available for both the NetBeans IDE and Eclipse. Both plug-ins support as-you-type validation, code completion, syntax highlighting, and hyperlink navigation (with Control-mouseover). JavaFX Script attempts to demonstrate that we're not exploiting the full capabilities of the Java platform for GUI development and that, together with supporting tools, the Java platform is highly competitive with or superior to competing GUI development platforms such as Adobe Apollo, Ajax/DHMTL Macromedia Flash/Flex/Open Laszlo, Microsoft WPF/XAML, and Mozilla XUL.

Norwegian start-up company Ezmo used Adobe Flex to eliminate waste from an early beta-release to enable a quick delivery with waste improvements. By removing JavaScript, Direct Web Remoting, Spring MVC and replacing them with Adobe Flex Ezmo was able to deliver what had taken 4 months in less than four weeks. Due to the support for rapid application development and the removal of architectural components which did not provide any added value. Developing web applications on the Java platform usually involves a lot of different frameworks, tools and platforms. In many projects all of these components are usually chosen before the requirements or scope has been determined for the project. Introducing the Adobe Flex framework enables developers to get a better understanding of requirements and scope without too much effort. Adobe Flex enables development teams to have designers and programmers work together in the same IDE. This makes the development faster and enables all team members to do what they know best. Introducing Life Cycle Data Services (LCDS) into Java development enables developer to create collaborative software straight out of the box. With push capabilities, support for partially connected applications, built in pagination and scalability LCDS is a powerful platform for Java application development
Reduce waste and complexity by removing your frameworks     Reduce use of complex patterns  Better User Experience with data driven applications      Experience and design matters, not frameworks. Live Cycle Data Services Data push  Reduce network traffic XML, foe not friend Rapid prototyping Functionality where it belongs Ezmo success story Required experience: none Expected audience: System architects, java-, web- and application developers.

Web 2.0 is one of the most important buzzwords in the last years, however what does this mean for Enterprise Java developers? Based on the practical case-study "Parleys.com" (a web 2.0 video streaming eLearning site) we'll have a closer look at which Java API's and frameworks are available to develop such a project. This first part of the presentation will start with an introduction on what Web 2.0 really is, followed with some Java related technologies used within the Parleys.com case-study. More specific we'll have a detail look at the state of the Dojo toolkit, how Flash with JavaScript integration can be accomplished, JSON and Confluence as a web 2.0 development platform. Ajax do's and don't s will also get covered based on the practical experience of several web 2.0 projects. The third part of the presentation will look at emerging Web 2.5 technologies that are appearing from vendors like Sun Microsystems, Google and Adobe focusing specifically on JavaFX, Flex2/Apollo and Gears.

Why stop object oriented programming at the web tier? Why settle for legacy ridden, prematurely optimizing, mind numbing frameworks when instead you could be having fun coding again? Enter Apache Wicket!
In this session, I will show you how you can use Apache Wicket to develop web applications with Just Java and Just HTML. I'll talk a bit about Wicket's philosophy and why it's developers believe it is important to take a novel approach. And then, because only code really talks, we'll take a deep dive to look at how to develop some custom, reusable components.

Direct Web Remoting (DWR) is an open source AJAX library. Its focus is on the core of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML(AJAX) programming; communication between client and server without having to load a whole page for each interaction. DWR basically lets JavaScript invoke Java functions on a server just as they were JavaScript functions running on the browser. The library supports a wide range of frameworks like Spring, JSF and Hibernate. For more advanced applications it also supports reverse AJAX. This means that the server can “push” data to web browsers instead of just having to respond to requests from the browser. Despite all its features DWR is quite easy to use and get started with and fits well into most Java Web applications. Therefore it is one of the most widely used AJAX frameworks around. This presentation is meant as an introduction to DWR. Its first focus is on DWR's features with examples on how they can be used in web applications. The second focus is on how to set up and to create an application. This will be accompanied with a few hits and tips from the use of DWR on real world applications. The purpose is for the attendants to be able to start using the basic features of DWR after the presentation.
Introduction – 5-7 min About the presentation About the speaker A DWR teaser Presentation outline Features - 6 minutes Possibilities Examples – 9 minutes Exploring the features What can we use DWR for Set up – 6 minutes Getting ready for creating the application Demonstration – 12 minutes Creating a little application Some tips along the way – 5 minutes Learn from some common mistakes Summary – 2-3 minutes Questions and Answers - 10 minutes Required experience: Basic knowledge about HTML, JavaScript and Java Web application development. Expected audience: The presentation is for those that want to get an introduction to one of the best known AJAX frameworks we have today and have some knowledge about Java Web development. They will know how to start using DWR on AJAX applications.

Java has penetrated most areas in software engineering today, from small embedded device to large, distributed enterprise systems. However, one area where Java still is absent is 3D desktop games. This session will demonstrate how easy it is to write a complete 3D game using Java and show that it is a viable platform for writing real, commercial desktop games. It will focus more on the different software components and less on 3D APIs, so very little knowledge about OpenGL and 3D programming is required.
Presentation agenda Introduction to game demo Tools, APIs and frameworks Java OpenGL Custom scene-graph and loading of 3D models 3D navigation Collision detection Multi-player solution Required experience: Intermediate Java experience Expected audience: Anyone interested in writing 3D applications and/or games using Java Additional information: The game will be a very simple third-person shooter with multi-player support. The entire game, source code, models and textures included, will be available as open-source online after the conference.

Running Java with limited resources takes a different approax to selecting frameworks and getting good responsiveness from the applicaiton. Key decisions: Do not use persistence frameworks, database or other out of process storage Use the tools in in java.util.concurrency library for nonblocking algorithms To avoid locking and deadlocks, use message driven and asyncron Traditionally Java is used in areas with lots of memeory, CPU and disk, but there is no reason for not using Java when resources are limited.
What we mean by Embedded Software in TANDBERG The embedded setting A short introduction to video conferencing and protocols What consequences have limited CPU and memory and no harddrive Early decissions Benefits of Java outweights the negatives, e.g Garbage Collection hits and no predictable performance We need Java5 (wasn't available at decisions time, but SUN promissed later) Create a simple message driven asynchronose framework Fast, soft realtime and hard realtime What is Real time java, JSR-1? What is fast compared to real time Why we choose not to use JSR-1 What can be learnt from looking into a real time Java runtime. Challenges What is fast enough? How to handle large amount of messages? How to introduce Java in a C/C++ shop? The beauty of lean principles? Defer commitment and deliver fast Experience Java can be very fast The Java toolset is excelent Spring2 and JPA are not for everyone

When making large web application controlling page flow is traditionally not very flexible or maintainable in mainstream web framework like STRUTS or JSF. This talk shows how to use Spring Web Flow (SWF) to control flow and what benefits and problems we experienced on a large JSF-based project. The benefits include richer model for the lifecycle of objects and more configurable flow between web pages. The problems ranged from the usual headaches of using XML closely tied to Java classes, bugs in the current implementation and the need to make a good design for how the flow should be. The talk will discuss some of the limitations in SWF, like no support for inheritance, and provide some work-around’s. Description of SWD taken from www.springframework.org: “Spring Web Flow is a next generation Java web application controller framework. The framework provides a powerful system for implementing navigation logic and managing application state consistently across a variety of environments. Spring Web Flow is a component of the Spring Framework's web stack focused on the definition and execution of UI flow within a web application. The system allows you to capture a logical flow of your web application as a self-contained module that can be reused in different situations. Such a flow guides a single user through the implementation of a business task, and represents a single user conversation. Flows often execute across HTTP requests, have state, exhibit transactional characteristics, and may be dynamic and/or long-running in nature. “
Required Experience: Knowledge of JSF

If you havent lived in a cave the last 2-3 years you have no doubt felt the buzz around SOA – Service Oriented Architecture. Perhaps you’ve seen the slides and white papers from evangelists and thought ’Thats all nice but what does it all mean?’. The talk aims to highlight that issue from a developers/architects standpoint and with basis in real life project experiences. The SCA (Service Component Architecture) initiative is quickly picking up speed as the best-practice way to implement service-oriented enterprise applications. Or put another way: SOA is growing up and getting a life. Get the dirt on SCA and find out how you can adapt to this step in the evolution of enterprise applications today by leveraging existing Java technologies.
Overview of SOA, challenges and visions, 5 mins Overview of the Service Component Architecture (Service Data Objects, SCA modules, Technologies etc), 15 mins Architectural Case Study – Real project experiences from adoption of SOA/SCA concepts within automotive, 30 mins Q & A, 10 mins Duration: 50 mins, 10 min Q&A Required Experience: The conceptual parts of the talk can benefit anyone involved in service-oriented development but to get full benefit of the case study part a good general working knowledge of Java Enterprise development is preferred. Expected Audience: Developers, Designers and Architects of Enterprise Applications with service-oriented ambitions. Although SCA is largely technology agnostic this talk is geared towards Java-based implementions.

Simplicity is perhaps the most important quality of software development. This session provides lessons learned from simplifications in an enterprise application development project. After more than two years of development the program seemed increasingly far from completion. Multiple re-planning exercises turned out to be futile. The projects were weighed down by complexity, preventing progress and destroying morale. The presentation will give concrete examples of how things can be done in a simple manner - as well as hideous examples of complexity - in areas such as platform and infrastructure, methodology and documentation as well as development, testing and change management. Why do you need a Business Process Engine when the standard Java Runtime is sufficient? How many people should be involved in deploying an application to system test? Should you roll your own component instead of acquiring a third-party library? Seeking simplicity in all areas is likely to result in considerable increased velocity, and arguably lead to increased maintainability and testability.
- Introduction - Simplicity is the opposite of complexity (5 min) - Simple platform - The JRE and lightweight frameworks (5 min) - Simple infrastructure - Redundancy, scalability and transactions (5 min) - Simple deployment - Self-contained and automated (5 min) - Simple design - Domain-Driven Design can lead to Big Design Up Front (5 min) - Simple documentation - Travel as light as you possibly can (5 min) - Simple functional testing - Tester Developers and Developer Testers (5 min) - Simple technical tests - The unit test from Hell, and other tests to avoid (5 min) - Simple code - Threading madness, and how TDD keeps you honest (5 min) - Simple development environment - Shrink-wrapped and ready to roll (5 min) - Simple operations - Start, stop, rollback and monitor (5 min) - Simple configuration management - Lists are waste; prevent bugs from slipping in (5 min) Required experience: The presentation will touch many areas of enterprise application development, from testing and development to infrastructure and deployment. Experience from a Java development project is recommended, but except a few examples the presentation does not require deep technical knowledge. Expected audience: The presentation is from an architects perspective, and should be relevant for developers, testers, project managers and architects.
Architect and Technology Competency Lead ( Bekk Consulting ) Trond Arve Wasskog is an architect and Technology Competency Lead at Bekk Consulting. He has been involved in Java and JEE application development for more than ten years, focusing on agile software development, testing and quality. Currently he is the architect of the NICS project at BBS

BBS develops and operates the systems behind the electronic payment methods that are available between and through the banks in Norway. We have a number of batch applications for processing transactions between accounts and banks, that communicate by sending messages. Clusterability, fail-over and total transactional integrity are natural requirements for both the applications and the communication infrastructure. We have developed a simple messaging solution with inherent fail-over capability and some load balancing, all running in the same transaction as the application's database access. Originally we started out with a commercial XA-compliant JMS solution, thinking it was the simplest thing that could possibly work. As we employed features such as fail-over, load-balancing and distributed transactions complexity and internal errors sky-rocketed. After about a year we gave up JMS and developed our own very simple solution. We think the reason for the success of our solution is simplicity and the fact that we only keep state the one place it belongs: the database. The talk will present how and why the BBS "message pump" works in unit tests and when clustered, and also why we think the JMS solution becomes more error-prone the more fail-over servers you add.
- Hello and intro - "What do we do": Bird's eye view of BBS's services and the Norwegian inter-bank infrastructure - Our base architecture/service abstraction: communicating void-method java interfaces - Mediating communication asynchronously with message-passing and claim-check pattern - The need for clusters, transactional integrity and guaranteed execution. - BBS Message pump: A simple pojo-based solution: design overview, state-management - Contrast: setting up and using High-Availability JMS - (if time allows: experience from development and operation of advanced JMS solutions) - Transaction state management with XA/distributed transactions and our experience from how it's solved in JMS - "HA Transactional" JMS will be less stable the more redundant servers you add - Conclusion: A note on how and where to manage execution state in transactional clustered solutions, and where NOT to keep it. Required experience General knowledge of distributed systems and transactions are required. Expected audience Developers and architects working with enterprise integration and/or systems including batch processing or order processing solutions.

Java SE 6.0 introduces Java Specification Request (JSR) 223, the Scripting for the Java Platform API, which allows you to evaluate scripts from within a Java application. Scripting languages have the advantage of being dynamically typed; they are in most cases interpreted, and do not require variable declaration or compilation. We will look into Project Phobos - a lightweight, scripting-friendly, web application environment running on the JavaTM platform. With Phobos, you can write web applications using several different scripting languages. The interactive development environment allows you to avoid explicit compilation and deployment steps, but still retain the power of the Java platform. After attending this session you should be able to harvest some of the advantages of the scripting API -for instance by starting to use the Phobos web application framework in your projects.
Outline Introduction (5min) ° JSR223 Examples of script programming on the Java platform (20min) ° JRuby ° JavaScript ° Velocity Phobos (20min) ° Lightweight, scripting-friendly, web application environment ° Demonstration Conclusions (5min) ° Summary ° Benefits Q&A (10min) Level Introductory / intermediate Required experience Curiosity Expected audience If you want to learn more about the scripting abilities in Java you should definitely attend this session

FIT is a framework that comes in various guises (Fit, Fitnesse, Fitlibrary), and can be used in different ways. The core principle behind writing FIT documents is to promote better communication between the stakeholders of a system. By using FIT, we can get our customers more involved in the design and specification. With the help of FIT documents, we will collaborate more closely and evolve a better shared understanding. As the system evolves, the collective set of FIT documents will provide a living specification - the place that everyone refers back to, to understand what the system actually does. In principle, using FIT is a good thing, but in practice we find that some teams struggle to use FIT documents effectively. Based on our experience, we provide our advice on what to focus on, and what to steer clear of when writing FIT documents in your team.

Imagine that you are responsible for driving a truck across America, along highways, through cities and around detours, dealing with whatever idiosyncrasies that weather and traffic might throw at you. Now imagine that your job is not to drive the truck, but program a computer to drive the truck for you. How would you go about turning over everything you know about driving to computer? Trying to plan a large software development effort is not much different than trying to plan the development of a software package to drive a truck across America – without access to the truck. In software development, we have been asked to solve too many truck-driving problems. And when it turns out that we have been handed an impossible problem, it’s usually the developers – not the process or the scale of the problem – that are held responsible for the failure. At its core, software development is the process of gradually finding ways to turn over more and more of what we know to computers so that we have more space left in our minds to discover ever more interesting things. This talk will look at successful development efforts on the scale of the truck-driving problem – the development of the Internet, for example – and offer a proven but neglected theory about how to develop complex software.

During the past 3-4 years BEKK has delivered many software development projects using an agile software development process - the majority contractually regulated by “Statens Standardavtale” or “PS2000”, but also regulated by other “proprietary” contracts. Agile and standard contracts have a very different approach to how some of the key processes should be organized and handled, and this can be a mine field if the parties involved are unaware and neglect spending the necessary time initially regulating those areas especially. In this presentation we will give the audience an insight in the knowledge and experience we have accumulated from both small and large engagements.
Introduction – key elements of standard contracts (5 min) Potential conflicts between standard contracts and agile software development (15 min) Pitfalls and experiences (30 min) Q&A (10 min) Required experience: Experience from software development in general, and agile software development in special. A basic understanding of the most common contracts used in Norway is also required to benefit most from this presentation. Expected audience: Anyone who is in the process of adapting agile software development where “Contract Negotiation” still is a significant part of the work involved.

Our reputation as estimators –even when we us agile methods -- is bad. Agile methods provide useful techniques and practices for teams and their customers to improve accuracy without creating illusions of precision. Many of our estimation problems come from misunderstanding and miscommunication about what estimates are and confusion with other related concepts like planning and targets. Where do errors come from, what can we promise and how do we best serve the primary purpose of software estimation process?
Intro – a typical conversation about estimates. 5 min What is an estimate (accuracy, precision, … a glossary) (15 minutes with quiz) Estimation purpose and how much estimation do we need (10 min) Techniques for estimation (10 min) Techniques to talk about talk about our estimates  – perception management (10 minutes) Q and A – capita selecta Required experience: All levels interested in estimation – as estimator and as customer of estimates. Expected audience: All involved in estimation and planning processes and sales, managers and executives who expect and use the results of that process.

We started of with a brief project description sounding something like this: “Our current intranet is out of date and we need a new one to meet our current needs”. Together with the customers project manager we toured the company and performed a number of workshops and interviews, gathering only the high level information we needed to specify and prioritize the “most wanted” requirements as User Stories. Using techniques as Behavior Driven Development, User Stories, MoSCoW prioritization, Planning Poker and a lot of facilitation we developed the requirement specification, without tons of documentation and months of work. No thick documents. No nitty gritty details. Only simple and clearly defined goals, user stories, estimates and a high-level plan for the project well anchored with the sponsors – and employees. The project is accepted and will now continue with the detailing of user stories to acceptance tests for implementation along the iterations - until the customer has the intranet they need. This talk is about how an agile specification approach and a team based on trust can specify the necessary requirement in a few weeks with same – or better – results, as opposed to spending months on detailed documentation. By the time Tom does his talk the project will be done and he will share the actual results with you. Was this agile requirement specification approach really that good? What could have been improved?
OUTLINE Project background - (5min) The Challenge – “Our intranet is falling apart – we have no time to loose!” (10min) The Process – “We need to prioritize and figure out where we can start – without knowing all the details” (25min) The Result – “20 hand written user stories – will it do?” (10min) Q & A (10min)    Required experience: Experience from system development projects   Expected audience: Systems Developers, Project Managers, Technical Project Managers, Business Analyst

The results are in ... Many ideas in the Agile canon and folklore can actually decrease your velocity or can slowly posion your code. Other contemporary fads have well-known pitfalls that have been forgotten since their last round of popularity. In this talk I look at five of these common practices, why they are harmful, and how to avoid their pitfalls:
TDD: Use lightweight architecture and an appropriate scope of testing to avoid architecture rot, high test maintenance cost, and usability problems. YAGNI: Use Case Slices and lightweight architecture can help avoid being blind-sided On-Site Customer: Add a product owner to avoid burning out both the customer and the team. User Stories: Instead of deferring detailed scenario development to your development during TDD, use Use Cases to bring the analysis out to the person who matters: the market constituency Domain-Specific Languages: Take the value from the analysis and run with it; sometimes, building a domain engineering environment buys you only cost and headaches These remedies work well with each other. Required experience : Some level of immersion in an industrial software development project. Expected Audience and Benefits : These simple tips will help the audience think about and avoid common pitfalls. It's not rocket science, but it's solid information that can help projects avoid getting into trouble.

The most productive large software project ever documented with over 1,000,000 lines of code was delivered by distributed, outsourced Scrum teams based in the U.S. and Russia. It was linearly scalable, directly contradicting the "Mythical Man Month" assertion that adding more people to a project that was late makes it go slower. A CMMI Level 5 company has gone totally to Scrum achieving linear scalability, doubling productivity, and deliverling 40% fewer defects with higher customer satisfaction. This presentation will make the case that the larger and more complex the project, the more benefits achievable with Scrum.
Expected audience: People interested in hearing about the best scrums in the world.

The world of software development is constantly changing and evolving. New ideas arise all the time and existing ideas go in and out of fashion. Software development processes find it very hard to keep up with this rapid rate of change, especially as they find themselves quickly going of fashion or becoming bloated as they bolt on more and more information. Teams find themselves struggling as they try to mix-and-match practices from various sources into a coherent way-of-working or work out where to start their improvements.
A new approach to capturing and sharing experience is required, one where: 1. Practices are First Class Citizens, 2. Practices can be made smart to truly help the developers in their work, 3. Practices can be used individually or in a multitude of combinations 4. Process is just a composition of Practices, and 5. Teams compose the process they need by selecting just the practice that they want to use To enable this a number of innovations are required: innovations related to the way that practices are collected, presented and applied. We will introduce the new paradigm and its support by EssWork which is an environment for working with practices. In doing so we will demonstrate how the Essential Unified Process is composed as a collection of eight separate practices. This talk promises to explore the outer limits of modern software development practices whether they come from the software engineering camp or from the social engineering (agile) camp.

Open source software is used in almost all new software development projects. However, a strategy for contributing back to the open source communites is often missing. When talking to business managers and developers, one of the key questions is often "what is in it for me?". In this presentation I will address this question both from a programmer's and from a manager's perspective. I will also debate licensing and intellectual property issues and the process of how to get involved in open source development.
Outline Why contribute from a developer perspective from a business perspective The contribution process, how to get involved To fork or not to fork, that is the question Creating patches How to maintain patches while awaiting committer approval Licensing and IP issues Q&A - 10 min Expected audience This session targets business managers, project managers and software architects and/or developers curious of how to embedd Open Source in their business stragegies

Ever since Struts, Web application development has changed : Web 2.0, and especially Ajax, has a big momentum, the introduction of JavaServer Faces in the new Java EE 5 stack has brought us new frameworks and concepts, while RAD has become a major factor to decision makers... Frameworks and tools available today have become more powerful, but also more complex. Hence choosing a framework for your web application has never been as difficult and important as today. Besides all these new functionalities, browser compatibility, URL friendliness, session management and the like remain as important to public web application developer as before. This session aims at sharing the information and experiences on frameworks available today, whether they builds upon Servlets or JavaServer Faces, but also those that will emerge in the future. We will emphasis on all the aspects of web application development and illustrate how different framework (such as Shale, WebWork aka Struts 2 and Rife among others) address those aspects in order to ease your web application development. This session will try to cover all different aspects of today's web-application development. Each aspect will be illustrated by how one of the available frameworks approaches it and solves it to enable the developer to focus on his part of the job: developing a high-quality web-application.

Did you ever want to be the Big Brother of the Java Virtual Machine? Being able to do non intrusive monitoring of method calls without access to the source code, performing this in a production environment without a noticeable performance hit? Do you want to know who is doing what to whom, that is, who invokes what method in context of which principal? Making certain that memory consumption is dynamically adjusted to avoid out of memory situations? Would you also like to use it in your legacy applications running pre Java 5 as well as utilize the new Java agent interface of the newer JVMs? You know you have to collect vast amount of data and process it effectively and in real time. Finally you figure out that the amount of data exceeds the capabilities of a traditional data model and you decide that the only solution is a dimensional data model, using MDX for multi dimensional analysis. There are numerous tools available for profiling and measuring your Java programs. However these tools are either: a) aimed at profiling or measuring your code in a development environment; b) expensive; c) not open source; d) requires a Ph.D. in debugging and profiling e) any combination of the above :-) Usemon (usemon.org) attempts to alleviate this by providing an open source tool which is easy to use, collects data from environments based upon Java 1.4 through 6, has a flexible dimensional data model stored in a SQL database and attempts to be non-intrusive. Usemon hooks into the Java virtual machine through a modified class loader on older JVMs or via the Java Agent Interface from version 5 and up. It automatically monitors Java EE components (EJBs, Servlets, MDBs, Queues, SQL Statements, etc), but can be configured to inspect any class in your JVM. Data is multicasted from agents to one or more collectors and stored in the DBMS of your choice. Usemon comes with a complete configuration for MySQL. The overhead of running Usemon is negligible and thus you may collect run-time statistics around the clock all year, which is rather fascinating, given that you have enough disk space. Usemon was developed for large Java EE environments at Telenor, which is one of the worlds largest telco to fulfill these requirements. You may utilize it in any environment in which you have control over the Java Virtual Machine start up parameters. For example Java EE applications, Spring based Web applications or simply your own home grown web application packaged in a .war file.
* Introduction * What sets Usemon apart from other profiling and performance measurement tools? * Modifiying the class loader using byte code manipulation * Architecture and extension points ** Using Soft references in the Agent to reduce memory consumption dynamically and letting the garbage collector (GC) to the job for you. ** Living in the Java virtual machine without affecting the production environment ** Collection of statistics and transmittal to the collector(s) using multicasting ** Receiving the collected data and insertion into a dimensional data model * Extending Usemon to your liking ** Usemon Live; A cool visualization app using the Processing (processing.org) framework and physics simulation model to show you what is happening in real time ** Dimensional data analysis, JasperServer to the rescue! * Q&A Expected audience Hard core developers with interest in performance and run time dependencies.

The Web as we know it is about to change. Welcome to the event-driven Web—a system that addresses the architectural flaws of the Web, and facilities uninitiated server-side messaging. That's right! The event-driven Web does not necessitate a "click" to deliver content. With this new paradigm, developers can initiate messages and events on the server—messages that are delivered to any type of Web client, including clients such as the iPhone, without the need for browser plug-ins or traditional polling. End-users receive streams of data, in real-time, making it possible to deliver data to clients as it arrives without the need to wait on a pool interval. Low latency delivery of information makes the Web an accommodating place for applications once thought to only be possible on the desktop, e.g., financial trading, auctions, sports betting, tools for analytics, business activity monitoring. To understand the concept of event-driven Web, you first must understand its origins, the technologies and requirements behind it, its place in your applications, and the pitfalls. In this session, we will introduce you to all of the above with special focus on the pitfalls related to reversing the Web with an event-driven paradigm. Considerations that we will discuss include connection limitations, network flooding, and scalability. In addition, attendees will be introduced to the various architectural options that are available to address these concerns. The techniques and technologies covered in this session include, but are not limited to Comet/Push implementations, Asynchronous Request Processing (ARP), and Java/JMS.
* Defining Real-Time Web * Correcting the Web (!) * Demo of Comet * HTTP Polling vs. Streaming * Scalability and Performance Concerns * Vertical Scalability * Horizontal Scalability * Message Distribution * DEMO * QA Required experience This session will go beyond Ajax with a dive into Java, so experience using Ajax and Java is required. Knowledge about HTTP is a plus. Expected audience This session targets anyone interested in providing realtime data over the Web using server-initiated message delivery and are looking for something that goes beyond, way beyond, boring chat examples.

With agile methodologies gaining adoption, organizations are quick to setup their CI infrastructure. Yet they soon realize that having a full CI strategy involves more than just a CI server. When is code being reviewed? Should the build break if a unit test fails? How to solve integration issues? Does your process need to go all the way up to releasing to production? In this Bird-of-a-Feather session we will share our experiences addressing these and more questions in large scale enterprise environments.

Lean and agile methods tell us to “see the system”. System thinking skills are important for all agile teammembers. However they are not part of our day-to-day toolkit we got in school or university. This session introduces the participants to 7 practical system thinking tools and visialisation techniques that will help us map and explore the dynamic complexity of our (software) projects. These tools can be used in retrospectives, kickoffs, to look at long term consequences of policies and choices. They support the (software) management process at all stages – from specifying problems, to construction and testing of hypothesis.
* Intro to systems and systems modelling (5 min) * Tradititional versus System Thinking skills (each 5 minutes – 35 minutes) ** Static -> dynamic (from focus on events to focus on patterns over time) ** System-as-effect -> system-as-cause (from viewing system as driven by external forces to ** placing responsibility for behaviour on internal actors who manage policies) ** Tree-by-tree -> forest thinking (from believe that really knowing depends on details to believing that we must understand context) ** Factors-thinking -> operational thinking (from listing factors of influence or correlation to understanding of causality and how behaviour is actually generated) ** Straight-line thinking -> closed-loop-thinking (from viewing causality as running one way to the effect of feedback and causes affecting each other) ** Measurement thinking -> quantitative thinking (from searching for perfect measures to accepting that we can always quantify but not always measure) ** Proven-truth thinking -> scientific thinking (seeking to prove to be right to recognizing frames and models have limited applicability) * For each of those skills we will present a good practice tool – model/drawing/brainstorm technique ** Dynamic thinking – behaviour over time diagrams ** System-as-cause – instead of blaming ask “how could those within the system make the system more resilient to external causes” – causal loop diagrams ** Forest thinking – focus on similarities rather than differences ** Operational thinking – ... * 20 minutes -- We will build a small model (requirements lack, change, shortcuts) with the participant (causal loop diagram) * 5 min> Q and A Required experience: Involvement in project at any level Expected audience: Managers, executotives, team leaders, scrum masters… interested in increasing their impact on systemic variable – quality, time to market…

Software development is hard. It takes years to become a good developer and many more years to become an expert. How much of this time is necessary? Are there any shortcuts?
In his book 'Blink', Malcom Gladwell makes the case that experts don't "think through" problems when solving them, they arrive at solutions almost unconsciously. The thing that differentiates an expert from a novice is not the ability to "reason through" but rather the ability to see a problem differently than a novice would. This different way of seeing is something that experts arrive at through their experience and long periods of exposure to problem contexts. In this talk, Michael Feathers will work you through a set of examples and describe concrete strategies for cultivating design sense - the ability to instantaneously recognize appropriateness and inappropriateness in software design.
Michael Feathers is a consultant with Object Mentor. He balances his time between working with, training and coaching various teams around the world. Prior to joining Object Mentor, Michael designed a proprietary programming language and wrote a compiler for it, he also designed a large multi-platform class library and a framework for instrumentation control. Publically, Michael developed CppUnit, the initial port of JUnit to C++, and FitCpp, a C++ port of the FIT integrated-test framework. Michael is also the author of the book 'Working Effectively with Legacy Code' (Prentice Hall 2004).

If you were the owner of an airline, what percentage of seats would you like to fill: 65% or 75%? If you were developing new components, what percentage should succeed: 50% or 100%? Surprisingly, a lean company would target the lower percentages and be more successful. How can this be? The first paradox of lean development is that by doing one thing at a time instead of trying to do many things simultaneously, everything will get done faster. The second paradox of lean development is that if you never fail, you never learn, and learning is the essence of product development. Come to this talk to hear why it is better to focus on throughput rather than utilization, and why you want to try lots of stuff and keep what works, rather than picking the winners in advance.
* Paradox 1: Thrashing, caused by overload, is much less efficient than leveling the workload and working at a regular cadence. * Queuing Theory applied to software development. * Six rules to reduce thrashing and speed software development throughput. * Paradox 2: Spending 10K on ten experiments is more likely to produce a winner than spending 100K on the best bet. * Set-Based design what it is and why it works * X rules to improve knowledge through exploring multiple options. Required experience General experience with agile development is useful. Expected audience Senior developers and testers, team leads, and managers. The objective is to get the audience to think, to challenge the assumptions that underlie how they organize their work, and experiment with new ways of organizing work to achieve dramatic improvement.

After Mary left the corporate world in 1998, she found herself managing a government software project where she first encountered the word -Y´waterfall.¡ When Mary compared her experience in successful software and product development to the prevailing opinions about how to manage software projects, she decided the time had come for a new paradigm. She wrote the award-winning book ´Lean Software Development¡ to explain how the lean principles from manufacturing offer a better approach to software development. Over the past six years, Mary has found retirement elusive as she lectures and teaches classes with her husband Tom. Based on their on-going learning, they wrote a second book, ´Implementing Lean Software Development.¡ A popular writer and speaker, Mary continues to bring fresh perspectives to the world of software development.

When the Spring framework hit the marked, it revolutionized the way we build our applications. Dependency injection, and inversion of control became well known terms, and it is difficult to imagine how we managed without them. But there is one aspect of the Spring framework that has been fiercely discussed for a long time; What is the best approach to configuring our applications for deployment in multiple environments? I have struggeled with this problem since my first encounter with the Spring framework, and over the years I have tried just about all the techniques there are. Some of them turned out to be bad - some of them turned out to be really bad. In this talk I will go through some of the techniques and approaches I have tried, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Based on these trials and errors, I have put together a framework that aims to enhance the Spring container - enabling it to be differently configured for different target systems. I will demonstrate how you can use this framework to make your applications dramaticly easier to configure, easier to test, and less prone to malconfiguration in production and test environments.
* The ultimate goal * Configuration techniques that failed miserably ** Using your build system for resource filtering ** JNDI as configuration repository ** Commons Configuration ** The evil PropertyPlaceHolderConfigurer * Introducing the Stage Enabled Spring Contexts project ** Brief introduction to annotation based configuration in Spring ** Choosing implementation of services based on the running environment ** Increase testablility ** Configuration options ** Handling property files * Customization options * Q&A - 10 min Language: English Level: Intermediate Required experience: Attendees will be expected to be experienced Java programmers with fairly good knowledge of the Spring framework. Experience with large scale enterprise applications would be a benefit. Expected audience: This session targets software architects and software developers, working on Spring based enterprise applications.

Domain-Specific Languages are an "architectural hot-spot", as coined recently by InfoQ editors. With dynamic languages such as Groovy, it is easy to create a mini-language modelling a particular business domain. Thanks to these DSLs, developers and subject matter experts will be able to share a common metaphor, to deliver, hand in hand, the final application to the end users.
Groovy offers a great deal of flexibility in terms of concise and expressive syntax, and through its dynamic nature. After an introduction to the Groovy dynamic language, and to the concepts of DSLs, their motivation, strenghts and weaknesses, Guillaume Laforge, project lead of Groovy and spec lead of JSR-241 standardizing the Groovy language, will guide you through the advanced Groovy concepts that will help you create your own embedded DSL. He will show you how to integrate them in your JEE application, and also explain how to best design such business languages to ensure their adoption by the end users, their quality, testability, andcapacity to evolve over time to suit the needs of the day. In the IT industry, understanding the domain within which customers evolve is a key factor in the success of a project. From this domain and its wealth of concepts, as software developers and architects, we can derive a design that is aimed at solving problems encountered in the day-to-day business. So far, we mostly solved these brainteasers with computer science paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming, n-tier architectures, or with tools such as rules engines to stay close to the domain at hand. In this session, our goal will be to investigate how the paradigm of Domain-Specific Languages can be leveraged to help our teams build solutions closer to our users' needs and requirements, and how it can provide a viable, efficient and expressive alternative problem-solving pattern. The technology of choice for enabling DSL solutions for your projects will be Groovy, a dynamic language for the Java platform.
Guillaume Laforge is the Groovy Project Manager, and Spec Lead of JSR-241, the Java Specification Request standardizing the Groovy dynamic language in the Java Community Process. As Vice President Technology of G2One, the company dedicated to the development of Groovy and Grails, he provides professional services around those technologies (training, support, and consulting). Guillaume co-authored the Groovy in Action best-seller book for Manning, and reviewed and wrote forewords for most of the Groovy and Grails books on the market. You can meet him at conferences around the world where he evangelizes the Groovy dynamic language, and the agile Grails web framework.

This talk focuses on the ways that Groovy can turn a traditional Java developer's world-view upside down.
Summary We'll start by talking about how you can thumb your nose at The Man by leaving out many of the main syntactic hallmarks of Java: semicolons, parentheses, return statements, type declarations (aka duck-typing), even try/catch blocks. Of course, there's no way that we'd leave metaprogramming out of the discussion... What is metaprogramming? We'll add new methods to classes at runtime -- even if they were originally implemented in Java; even if they were declared final. (Thanks, ExpandoMetaClass!) We'll call methods that don't exist and avoid the dreaded MethodNotFound Exception. (Thanks, invokeMethod!) We'll narrowly scope our metaprogramming shenanigans using Use blocks and Categories, and then cast our changes to the wind such that every instance of a class gets our added juice. If you are happy taking the Blue Pill, this talk is not for you. You can continue using Groovy as a slimmed-down dialect of Java -- an "After" picture to Java's "Before". If, however, the Red Pill looks interesting, please join me. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more. Expected audience: This session is aimed squarely at Java developers. The more experience you have, the better, but even neophytes will appreciate what Groovy offers Java developers. Experience with other dynamic languages like Ruby, JavaScript, or Python will help, but certainly isn't required. Required experience: You should be comfortable with the basic syntactic rules of Java (so that we can mercilessly squash them). You should understand the basic "Laws of Java" when it comes to the semantics of a statically typed language (so that we can kick sand in its face). Most importantly, you should posses an open mind and a belly full of Dynamic-language KoolAid. This is not the forum for someone to vocally defend the merits of checked exceptions and static typing. You will be unceremoniously tossed out on your ear, Jerry Springer-style. Seriously. I'm not trying to convince you that this is the way you should write Java. The status quo can defend itself quite nicely, thank you very much. I'm here to show you how your code could look, if you so desire.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides a fantastic way to deploy scalable machine images, but what to do when you want an application to scale across the machine images you have provisioned? This session discusses the Elastic Grid, an approach that provides dynamic allocation, management, and scalability of applications, using Amazon EC2 as the backbone. It also introduces the open-source technologies Elastic Grid is based on: Rio and Apache River (Jini™ network technology). The Elastic Grid provides an architecture for developing, deploying, and managing distributed applications composed of services. Key to the architecture are a set of dynamic capabilities and reliance on policy-based and quality-of-service mechanisms. The Elastic Grid reduces the complexity surrounding the development of dynamic services by introducing Jini network technology remoting for POJOs as well as by providing a simple component model. The Elastic Grid extends Amazon EC2's virtual grid environment, enabling users to manage and dynamically scale Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) based on declarable SLAs, as well as deal with partial failure of AMI instances. Rio reduces the complexity surrounding the development of dynamic services by introducing dynamic Jini network technology remoting for POJOs, as well as providing a simple component model. The presentation demonstrates how IntelliJ plug-ins for Amazon EC2 and Rio ease building and deploying a sample application distributed over the Amazon EC2 grid. With the Elastic Grid solution, the application will scale on the Amazon EC2 grid by starting and stopping Amazon EC2 instances accordingly to declared SLAs (service-level agreements).
Required Experience: None Expected Audience: Users of Amazon Web Services in need of a good solution for scalability and management of their applications.
Jérôme Bernard has over eight years experience developing J2SE, J2EE and distributed applications applied to a wide range of applications from banking to insurances as well as distributed applications using Jini. He is currently working on a solution called Elastic Grid which is a mix of Amazon EC2 and Rio/Jini. Some few things I've been working on: * various IntelliJ plugins (http://blog.elastic-grid.com/intellij/) * Rio committer (http://rio.dev.java.net)

Service Oriented Architecture is all over us. There seems to be some kind of consensus that one type of SOA services are services that are responsible for the core business objects - and vendors are monitoring and releasing their SOA Data Server products to close the gap. By pioneering the SOA space with EDR, we have gained lots of valuable of experiences of how to solve the Master Data challenges in SOA. This talk will discuss the main contenders for the ownership of your business objects definitions, and comment on their consequences - and then follow up with a "less is more" approach to enable companies to gain the combined advantages of all the platforms by extending the EDR pattern to also include Master Data Service (MDS) features.
* Introduction * Problem description * Solution strategies - strength and weaknes analysis * How to do more with less - EDR MDS concepts and tradeoffs * Experience reports * QA Required experience Intermediate knowledge of architecting and building SOA systems. Experience with Master Data Management chellenges and integration strategies. Expected audience Architects, Developer-leads and project managers.

Newspeak is a new programming language being developed at Cadence. Newspeak is directly descended from Smalltalk, with heavy influences from Self and Beta. Newspeak is a principled dynamic language, and incorporates lessons drawn from a decade of experience maintaining the Java language and VM specifications.
Newspeak takes the principle of programming to an interface to its logical conclusion: every operation in Newspeak is effectively a virtual method invocation. This includes references to fields, classes and superclasses. Classes my nest arbitrarily, as in Beta. Since all names are late bound, all classes are virtual; in particular, superclasses are virtual, so all classes act as mixins. There is no static state in Newspeak. Instead, top level classes act as module definitions, which are independent, immutable, self-contained parametric namespaces. They can be instantiated into modules which may be stateful and mutually recursive. Naturally, like its predecessors, Newspeak is reflective: a mirror library allows structured access to the program meta-level, including the ability to modify the code while it executes. Synergy between a small number of key design decisions makes for a language that is small, expressive, modular, and lays a foundation for security as well.
Gilad Bracha is the creator of the Newspeak programming language. He is currently Distinguished Engineer at Cadence Design Systems. Previously, he was a Computational Theologist and Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems. He is co-author of the Java Language Specification, and a researcher in the area of object-oriented programming languages. Prior to joining Sun, he worked on Strongtalk, the Animorphic Smalltalk System. He received his B.Sc in Mathematics and Computer Science from Ben Gurion University in Israel and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Utah.

This talk focuses on integrating Groovy with your legacy Java codebase in a way that wouldn't raise an eyebrow in the most conservative of organizations.
Summary We'll look at the dramatic reduction in line of code you can achieve by simply flipping your POJOs to POGOs (Plain Old Groovy Objects). We'll talk about calling Java classes from Groovy, and calling Groovy classes from Java. We'll look at Groovyc, the integrated compiler that manages Groovy/Java dependencies without a hiccup. There are wild-eyed radicals out there telling you that Java is dead, statically-typed languages are passe, and your skills are hopelessly out-of-date. Those extremists are the same ones who don't bat an eye at throwing out years of experience to learn a new language from scratch, pushing aside a familiar IDE for a new one, and deploying to a whole new set of production servers with little regard to legacy integration. While this "burn the boats" approach to software development might sound exciting to some folks, it's giving your manager the cold shakes right now. What if I told you that there was a way that you could integrate seamlessly with your legacy Java code, continue to use your trusty IDE and stable production servers, and yet take advantage of many of the exciting new dynamic language features that those fanatics keep prattling on about? You'd probably say, "Groovy!" I would, too... Not once will I tell you to throw out the old in favor of the new. In each case, I'll show you how to integrate the new with the old. Don't throw out your Ant build scripts; mix in a bit of Groovy to spice 'em up. Don't toss out your existing unit tests. (You are unit testing, aren't you? AREN'T YOU?) If not, Groovy is the perfect excuse to get started with a new language in way that improves the quality of your Java application without actually putting the new code into production. That is, until you get hooked on doing things the Groovy way... If the Red Pill of Dynamic Languages scares the pants off of you (or your manager), don't worry about it. The Blue Pill still offers plenty of benefits. There is no other language on the JVM that offers you the level of deep Java compatibility such that you could rename your "dot J-A-V-A" files to "dot G-R-O-O-V-Y" and not skip a beat. Of course, they both end up with a "dot C-L-A-S-S" extension at the end of the day, so there's good chance that no one would ever be the wiser anyway. Groovy: funny name, serious software, and Java through-and-through. Expected audience: This session is aimed squarely at Java developers. The more experience you have, the better, but even neophytes will appreciate what Groovy offers Java developers. Required Experience: Nothing more than standard Java knowledge.

Scrum was designed to achieve a hyperproductive state where productivity increases by 5-10 times over industry averages and many collocated teams have achieved this effect. The question for this presentation is whether distributed, outsourced teams can consistently achieve the hyperproductive state. In particular, can a team establish a localized velocity and then maintain or increase that velocity when distributing teams across continents.

Building sexy software that users love is usually a challenging endeavor. The open source Flex SDK and Java are a perfect combination of technologies for building rich, sexy software - for the web and the desktop. Flex applications can run in the browser using the ubiquitous Flash Player or on the Desktop using the new Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). In both instances Java can be used for the back-end of the application. The communication between the Java back-end and Flex front-end can utilize a number of different communication protocols, but the easiest and best performing is the open source BlazeDS library. This session will cover the basics of using Flex, Java, and BlazeDS to build sexy software for the web and the desktop.

Development is about more than writing code. It is even about more than writing tests! In order to produce something of value, we have to deliver reliable software into production. In an organization where the consequence of failure is great, we need to make sure that what we deliver works as intended. At the same time, even in a seemingly static world, many problems are hidden until the very end of the project. To make matters worse, complex technology and organizational processes inhibit our ability to act to new information with sufficient speed. The talk shows how we can implement a rigorous, yet agile process. It is based around our experiences of putting the good idea of continuous integration and other agile methods into life and using this as the basis not just for the technical process, but for the whole improvement program for our organization. We have expanded our process to cover simulated production as a part of the testing effort. This way, we can guarantee that the actual delivery day will be uneventful. The audience will come away from the talk with a good idea on how to improve their build process. The talk will cover both practical aspects, architectural changes that improves continuous integration, and what change you need to make in your organization to streamline the value chain from a code change to production readiness.
Required experience: The participants should have worked with Java in an enterprise context or had architectural responsibility for such a project. Expected audience: Architects and developers will come away from the session with an understanding of what part of the agile hype is real, what it requires to adopt, and how to get started.

Scala fuses object-oriented and functional programming concepts into an elegant, statically typed programming language for the Java Platform. The name Scala stands for "SCAlable LAnguage."
It is scalable in the sense that it is designed to be useful in a wide range of tasks, scaling up to very large programs written by many people and down to short scripts written by individuals. The conciseness and expressiveness of Scala gives it the feel of dynamic languages such as Python or Ruby, but Scala also provides a rich static type system that can help programmers prevent errors. In this talk, Bill Venners will give an introduction and overview of the Scala programming language.

Apache Tapestry is an open source Java framework that combines the best features of two worlds: the heavy-duty performance and scalability of Java (not to mention its enterprise acceptance) with the productivity advantages of scripting languages such as Ruby. Java has emerged as the language for enterprise-class development: it has the widest adoption, the largest class libraries, the best performance, and greatest degree of enterprise acceptance ... and yet, traditional web development is a painful, unproductive slog: large amounts of configuration combined with constant recompiles and redeployments. Python and Ruby can be vastly more productive than Java but can't match Java in terms of performance and scalability, or acceptance in the enterprise. Tapestry bridges the gap between these two worlds. It embraces convention over configuration on many levels. It enhances productivity with live class reloading (changes to classes are picked up without a redeploy or restart) and best-of-breed exception reporting. Tapestry classes and templates are small, simple and immediately understandable. Tapestry applications are fast, efficient and highly scalable. Tapestry lets you work in terms of your objects and your methods: you can build entire applications and never think about a URL or a query parameter. Things just work! Tapestry is a component framework; we'll see how the built-in components provide broad functionality and yet are extremely extensible. Many of the components have built-in Ajax functionality, and building your own components is a snap. This session will feature live demonstrations and even a bit of live coding. We'll demonstrate how Tapestry keeps you happy and productive like a Ruby or Python coder but still delivers the results your boss and your customers need.
* Introduction * Action vs. Component Frameworks * Tapestry Pages and Components * Building a basic CRUD Form * Customizing the CRUD Form * Processing a Form Submission ** Event Propogation ** Return Values * Using the Grid Component * Customizing Grid Columns * Linking to a Detail Page * Using Ajax with Tapestry ** Autocomplete Field ** Dynamic Ajax Zones * Other Tapestry Topics * Conclusion * Q & A Required Experience: Basic understanding of Java, HTML and XML Expected Audience: Java web developers

FitNesse is becoming a buzz word in the Agile community. People have seen it used in small examples, but may not think it is appropriate for their project. This session will show how it has been a great success factor in a critical Norwegian banking project at BBS, and how it was valuable to both developers and domain experts. The talk will present technical tips and tricks with code examples for writing reusable and maintainable tests and code. It will take you through the obstacles we met along the way, and how we overcame them.

Code coverage is a lousy test quality indicator. Mutation analysis and testing, on the other hand, provides a better technique to improve your tests. This involves mutation of source code by introducing or modifying statements in small ways. The purpose is to develop effective tests or locate weaknesses in existing tests. This session gives an introduction to mutation testing, available tools and techniques. The content will consist of many examples, demonstrating mutation testing and the effectiveness of this technique.
* What is mutation testing and analysis? * A few of examples setting the stage * An overview of mutation operators * Tools and integration with the IDE and build system * Mutation test demonstrations * Summary - Guidelines and caveats * Questions Required experience Knowledge of Java programming and testing is recommended. Expected audience This will be a techy session targeting developers and architects.
Trond Arve Wasskog is a developer and CTO at Bekk Consulting. He has been working with Java and Java EE application development for more than ten years, focusing on agile software development, testing and maintainability.

This talk will focus on a special kind of wicked software projects - enhancement projects. They are very common and generally overlooked. Wicked enhancment projects exhibit many of the following characteristics: * The project is delivering something like version 5.7 or 6.0 of a successful software product * There is a large, buggy, legacy code base with little documentation * There is a large number of product variations (configurations) * The customer and user base is large and inhomogenous * The original development team is long gone ** Sponsor/general management has lost interest (until something goes wrong) ** The current development team is doing all of support, O&M, and fresh development ** Activities other than developent consume a significant portion of the effort ** The developer motivation is low (churn is high) ** There is a high number of external dependencies ** Requirements are volatile ** Firefighting is the norm – defined processes are missing or frequently circumvented Enhancement projects are especially hard because their origin is a successful product. The risk is generally high (chance of jeopardizing the whole customer base), but not treated as such. Success is expected, but many of the mechanisms for ensuring success are not in place.
The presentation will give practical advice on how to manage such projects, and will cover: * What wicked projects are * The life (and death) of a software product ** Handling support and O&M in parallell with development work ** Improving quality ** Handling bugs, requirements and releases ** Handling estimation, planning and monitoring of progress ** Handling expectation management and communications in general ** Handling external dependencies We will focus on presenting practices that have proved beneficial in projects of this kind, and that should be part of any project manager's toolbox. Some practices we'll cover are: * Bug-Driven Development: Using bugs to improve overall code quality * Don't Estimate - Timebox. When not to estimate * Don't Judge - Count. Improving estimates by freeing developers from time estimates * Pay your debt: When and how to work off technical debt * Two-page Architecture: Sufficient technical documentation * Information Gatekeepers: Preventing information overload and thrashing * Prioritized Feature List: Controlling volatile requirements * Planning Horizons: How much to plan Language: English Level: Intermediate Required experience: Project management (software development) Participation in software development projects Expected audience: Project managers, project owners, other project participants

Good tools for automated web-testing have been around for quite some time, and many projects are starting to include them as a part of their build-process. We started using web-tests on Storebrand's online insurance-application back in autumn 2006, and the project is still supported by web-tests this very day. The talk gathers on experiences from this and various other Objectware projects, putting together a good bunch of experiences, recommendations, guidelines and hints for getting your project's web-testing in order. Topics include: * Why web-tests are evil! * When should you NOT use web-tests * How many web-tests should you maintain? * How you can get the users to report bugs by writing tests for you * Getting a CI/testing server to run the tests for you * Combining web-tests with FitNesse acceptance testing * Behaviour Driven Development using RSpec with web-tests * Project testing strategy (and where web-tests fit in)
* Background ** A trip down memory lane in Storebrand: How did we get started? ** How we learned to love web-testing, and ** How we learned to hate it. * Web-testing practices ** Testing the web and nothing but the web ** Black-box testing ** Acceptance/system testing ** Integration testing ** How to fit web-tests into the rest of your test-model ** How web-tests can give you good URLs and HTML design ** Running web-tests on the Continous Integration server ** Getting your users to help out: delivering bug reports with test-scripts ** Test fixtures * Advanced web-testing ** Acceptence web-testing combining FitNesse and Selenium ** Behaviour-Driven Development with web tests (Selenium combined with the RPsec Story Framework) ** Web tests from a test strategy perspective ** How to scale (with Selenium Grid) * Pitfalls ** Too many tests ** Too slow tests ** The tests break all the time! ** Some refactoring breaks all the tests ** Using web-tests for everything ** How to combine system testing with manual testing ** Capturing system requirements in web tests * QA Required experience: No particular experience is strictly required, but having tried out some web- testing tool could be an advantage. Expected audience: * Web developers * QA/testers * People interested in testing in general By attending this presentation, participants will learn... * How to get started with web-testing * How to keep doing it successfully * How to use web-tests as part of an agile project

Resource Oriented Computing systems process resource representations, execute transformations and computations by defining processing in terms of compositions and asynchronous sequences of resource requests. Application development and deployment using SOA faces problems when organizational changes occur if the participating systems (service providers and consumers) are too tightly coupled. In SOA, messages and systems are inherently synchronous, promoting dependencies that filter to the organizational level. Resource Oriented Computing solves system and application integration issues by leveraging ESB, domain-specific languages, and shared memory mechanisms for integrating coupling points, not the applications themselves, by promoting event-driven interactions between system components, and by creating logical mappings of resources such as data or computations that are abstracted from the physical manifestation of the system deployment.
Who should attend * Infrastructure architects * Application architects * Senior developers * Application development managers Why do attendees need to be aware of this information today? * Systems are built through the integration of decoupling points via ESBs, domain-specific languages, and shared memory mechanisms instead of direct integration of services, which is less flexible and more expensive in response to workflow or organizational changes * Event-driven systems allow for shorter time-to-market application development and integration independently of organizational changes * Treat computational resources as addressable entities (i.e. via object references, URIs, callbacks, etc.) that may be consumed on-demand rather than being intrinsically tied to specific applications * Event-driven systems can be implemented by leveraging existing infrastructure and SOA investment * Balance open-source vs. commercial products to avoid lock-in that results in higher costs and little or no flexibility during integration What basics should attendees know before attending this session? * Enterprise service bus * Basic understanding of distributed data caching technologies * Enterprise integration patterns and SOA * Event-driven distributed programming basics * Java 5 or later * Domain-specific language basics What problem(s)/challenge(s) will an attendee learn to solve by attending this session? * How to develop complex applications within very tight deadlines by formalizing system integration around a resource-oriented model * How to turn SOA-based systems into callbacks, breaking the rigid provider/consumer model * How to develop event-driven applications based on technologies and services already in production using a multi-language approach * How to integrate the existing applications by applying event-driven rather than centralized control techniques * How to extend SOA beyond transactions to include workflow processes and lossless transformations of resources from one representation to another What else will attendees learn by attending this session? * Real world applications that use Mule ESB, OpenSpaces, Terracotta and OSGi * Examples of architecture, service objects, configuration files * Approaches to solving distributed data caching

The revered Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) book is indispensable for handling messaging-based integration, but utilizing these patterns in your own code can be tedious, especially if you have to write the code from scratch every time. Wouldn't it be nice if you had a simple API for these patterns that makes this easier? Enter Apache Camel, a message routing and mediation engine that provides a POJO-based implementation of the EIP patterns and a wonderfully simple Domain Specific Language (DSL) for expressing message routes. This session will introduce and demonstrate the power of Camel. So go on, take a Camel ride!

In the current programming culture we have lost the OOP idea of objects containing both logic and state, the idea of reuse has largely failed due to impractical mechanisms, and combining pieces of code into larger structures using AOP has not quite delivered on its promises. Building large-scale software also gives us challenges with regard to complexity, enforcing architectural rules and codebase explosion. What if we could look at what we have and figure out a new way to address these problems, while promoting the idea from domain oriented modeling and retaining what works with what we have now? Composite Oriented Programing is a new way of dealing with these problems, and this presentation will show how the Qi4j implementation on the Java platform will enable you to get more done with less work, and in a way that allows you to avoid the mentioned problems. It will describe the COP terminology and show examples on how to use Qi4j to implement domain oriented models.
Suggested experience AOP, EJB, DDD, Java Expected audience Developers who want to understand what COP and Qi4j is all about should go. Understanding and using Qi4j will give developers a new tool that enables them to more easily write reusable code using the concepts from Domain Driven Design.

Some of the promises of Topic Maps, is the possibility of being able to easily structure and rearrange the model, as well as placing semantics where they are needed. Implementing such a dynamic and rich model, is not easy with an Object Oriented language like Java. The proposition of the authors, is that one can assist composing a song from audio fragments with the help of simple heuristics. Given that the audio is tagged with human recognisable information such as verse, refrain, lyrics, speed, starting and ending points. Storing such diverse information in a Topic Map is fairly trivial, but creating a dynamic Java model which can represent this is not, and the talk will discuss this topic further. The audience will be introduced to simple concepts of Topic Maps and music composition theory. The talk will finally present Vaudeville, the deliverable of the Customer Driven Project, made by students at NTNU. Vaudeville showcases Java technologies, assisted music composition and other concepts behind the project.
* Structure of the talk * About the authors * Aerobic Instructor/Deaf Composer - User Stories * Short introduction to fundamentals of music composition and DJing * Tagging music fragments with human readable information * Why working with Topic Maps is different * The problem of implementing rich models in OO * Creating a dynamic model from Java objects, while keeping complexity low * Presentation of Vaudeville - The DJ´ing application created in KPRO * Questions Expected audience Anyone interested in multimedia, Topic Maps and Object Oriented theory The audience will be introduced to simple concepts of Topic Maps and music composition theory.

Java SE is on over 90% of desktops and Java ME is on over 90% of mobile phones. Java is also making a big dent in the consumer space such as set top boxes, Blu-Ray Disc players and so on. Although Java client technology is ubiquitous, consumer applications are not because development and deployment for consumers is still too hard.
The talk will explore the features that are being explored to create leaner and meaner JRE that eases deployment and installation. The features that are being looked into will ease start-up time, provide a quick launch and on-demand installation, among other things. The talk will explore the Java Kernel and other features that ease applet and application instantiation and deployment. We will also look at features that enable building richer client applications with Java SE 6 Update 10. The talk will also look into features of Java SE 7. After attending this session attendees should be able to walk away with a good understanding of where the Java SE platform is headed and how this should ease their development and deployment concerns for consumers.

The topic of this presentation is about fastest growing open source Java grid computing framework called GridGain and how its focus on elegant simplicity and Enterprise Java integration is helping to revolutionize the grid computing for Java in the same way as Spring or JBoss have changed Enterprise Java landscape. The presentation will start with an introduction to grid computing and specifically data and compute grids. MapReduce will be discussed. Real-life examples will be discussed as well as common pitfalls, patterns and anti-patterns of using grid computing in real life. After introduction a comparison between GridGain and Hadoop (another popular MapReduce implementation) will be given with usual pros and cons of both projects. To underscore the topic of presentation it will also include live demonstration of writing a simple application and grid enabling it to run on a small grid right in front of the audience. All coding during demonstration will be done live. Detailed and in-depth explanations will highlight that grid computing in Java can be fun, simple and productive to use in everyday applications and systems.
* Introduction * What is Grid Computing? ** Compute grids (MapReduce) ** Data grids * Why is Grid Computing? ** Real-life examples ** When to use grid computing? ** When NOT to use grid computing? * MapReduce: GridGain vs. Hadoop ** Pros and Cons * What is GridGain? * Key Features * Live coding demonstration * Conclusion * Q&A About GridGain: GridGain is the fastest growing open source Java grid computing framework. In the first 6 months since the first release in august 2007 GridGain has been downloaded over 15000 times, used by more than 500 unique projects and grid node with GridGain starts somewhere around the globe every 60 seconds. GridGain has active production and testing users on all continents and in over several dozen different countries. GridGain project has financial sponsorship of GridGain Systems that sponsors the development and provides commercial services around it.

4 years ago one had to spend literally millions of NOK just for the publishing rights to implement a good map solution with a detailed map of Norway. Additionally, many projects had a complex client combining javascript and a server side component for displaying the map in the browser, and probably a back end for rendering the maps. Then in 2005 Google launched Google Maps, opened its API, and one could add a map to a project in minutes. Decent map quality, free client and no need to pay a fee for publishing rights.
* Introduction ** What's in it for me! Why is an open source map client interesting? * A few concepts ** Projections. Why it matters, and what you need to know about it. ** Libraries for projections, proj4 and derivatives. A short, short ** slide about the math. * Map data ** Free WMS sources. NASA. Google. ** Why you need a tile cache, and how can make one. * Combining other geographical information ** Let's integrate and plot data from some sources. Perhaps Flickr and Yr? * Why Oslo Plaza suddenly may be in surrounded by water, if you didn't understand projections. * Demo ** Putting it together, combining map data and sources. * Tile cache ** How to determine if you need one, and how to size it. A simple demo in java. Required experience: Curiousness for map. The mapping concepts will be simplified. Level: Introductory Expected audience: Those who wants to implement a map solution, and those who have geographical data and wonder how they can use it better.

Byte code manipulation has become increasingly popular over the last years. It is used by JPA implementations, application servers, AOP libraries, web frameworks, monitoring systems, profilers, clustering solutions, scripting languages, workflow engines, and much more. In fact, most of today's applications will most probably rely on byte code manipulation, often even without realizing. Application developers however seem to be overly careful and often frown upon byte code manipulation as an arcade art that is risky and difficult to understand. This presentation will show you that it's easier than you think. We'll go over concise examples that illustrate the concepts. Distinct patterns, coming from different domains, will give you ideas about adopting byte code manipulation for your own products. You'll learn arguments to reassure skeptics and see how the manipulation can plugged into your tool chain. We'll finish off with tips and tricks to write maintainable code with the ASM library. After this session you'll see byte code manipulation as another tool in your arsenal and you'll have a good picture of how to start using it yourself.
* Introduction * What is byte-code manipulation? * Popular projects and what they use it for * Don't be afraid * Plugging in the manipulation * Code examples from open-source projects using ASM * Tips, tricks and gotchas * Q/A Language: English

As the number of services and applications inside your organization grows, it becomes increasingly hard to manage and control. When this happens it is important to start looking at implementing SOA governance. Because SOA governance is not widely understood (or is widely misunderstood), many common mistakes arise which result in duplicate efforts, less reuse, less interoperability and increased development time. During this talk we'll look at what exactly SOA governance is while exploring 5 common mistakes and how to avoid them.
* What is Governance? * What tools help you with governance? * What are a registry/repository? * 5 Common mistakes in SOA governance: ** Thinking governance is a product ** Not having a centralized source of truth ** Not enforcing architectural best practices ** Reinventing the wheel ** Inconsistent deployment strategies

Domain Driven Design with Object-Relational mapping is the state of the art for testable object oriented programming in domains with complex business rules. However, sometimes the domain contains natural relations and object graphs that are too large to fit in main memory. Even when you have sufficient memory, working with large object graphs that are naively OR-mapped can easily give you performance problems. Bjørn Bjerkeli and Eirik Maus present a few techniques they've used at BBS to handle the one-to-too-many-relations (almost) without sacrificing working on a pure domain model. These include domain object fields based on database queries, iterators that "page" entities in and out of memory and simplified methods for background fragment processing.
* Problem description * Relations and collections with Object-Relational Mapping libraries (Hibernate) * Fix for "running out of time": avoiding needless lazy-loading of large relation set for simple summation * Fix for running out of memory: Paged Iterations / moving objects out of memory again * Fix for running out of both time and memory: background fragment processing * Things we haven't tried yet that we think might work * Summary Duration: 50 + 10 min Language: The talk can be given in english or norwegian. Slides in english Level: Intermediate Required experience: Prior exposure to SQL databases and Object Relational mapping is recommended Expected audience: Developers and solution architects

REST, the REpresentational State Transfer, is the architectural style underlying the HTTP protocol. In the last couple of years, REST has emerged as a compelling and simpler alternative to SOAP/WSDL/WS-*-based distributed architectures. In this session, Arjen will explain what REST is, how it can be used to build Web Services, and where it makes sense to use. We will look RESTful frameworks such as JSR-311, but focus on creating RESTful Web services with the Spring framework. This will include the features included in the current release of the Spring framework, and new features that are coming in the next major release.
We will start by giving an overview of REST: where did it come from, how does it work, and how can it be used to build a distributed architecture? Using illustrative examples, we will try to find an answer to these questions. Next, we look at some of the current frameworks and tools which can be used to build web services. We will look at Spring-MVC and JSR-311 (also known as JAX-RS) on the server-side, and also investigate client- side options, such as the plain HttpURLConnection, and the more mature Commons HttpClient. Prerequisites: Spring framework knowledge

You are a programmer on the Java platform, and you have been hearing more and more about Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and JRuby. What's this stuff all about? Why would a Java programmer care about these technologies? How will it make you, as a programmer on the Java platform, more productive? Over the past two years. Ruby on Rails has brought the Ruby programming language into the mainstream. Ruby offers a cleaner, simpler, faster, and much more fun language for day-to-day development. Rails has changed the face of web development with legendary productivity gains and minimal configuration. The two are now available for your Java platform projects with JRuby, an implementation of Ruby for the JVM. In this session, we'll walk through how you can get JRuby up and running. We'll demonstrate common use cases for JRuby like GUI development, web development with Ruby on Rails, and more. By the end of this session, you'll be ready to download JRuby and start adding it to your own projects, or start a few new ones. JRuby is ready for you!

Unit testing has become a mainstream task. Most developers do it. Most project leaders and architects expect their team to write tests. However, practice has taught us that a lot of teams write few tests, or spend too much time writing and maintaining them. Different development teams make common mistakes, run into similar issues and find their own solutions for them. This costs a lot of valuable time.
Unitils started in 2005, when a group of developers and architects joined in a task force to share their testing experience. These discussions resulted in a set of testing guidelines. The leaders of this task force started writing code to help implementing these guidelines. Unitils has emerged from concrete experience and lessons learned, with the ultimate goal of making unit testing easy, effective and maintainable. Unitils offers a lot of support in testing the database layer: automatic maintenance of test databases, automatic post-processing of the database to make it more test-friendly, loading test data using DbUnit and verifying the contents of the database after execution of a test. Unitils provides specific support for testing with JPA or hibernate, and offers integration with spring. It makes abstraction of the testing framework that is used for executing the tests, making it useable with JUnit3, JUnit4 or TestNG. But Unitils is not limited to persistence layer testing only: The reflection assert utility is a very useful alternative to the classic assertEquals method with a range of leniency options. Unitils also provides superior support for dynamic mock objects, offering a simple syntax for specifying method behavior and verifying expectations. During this talk, I will present the different features of Unitils using simple, concrete examples. I will talk about problems from real projects and demonstrate how Unitils helps solving these problems. * Introduction * Feature overview: Using examples, I’ll demonstrate the features of Unitils: assertion using reflection, test data management, test database maintenance, JPA / hibernate and spring integration, testing with mock objects. * Demo: demonstration of the database maintainer, JPA / hibernate entity-database mapping test * Architecture: Provide some insight into how Unitils works. * Summary and roadmap: What are our plans for the future * Q & A Required experience: Basic experience with unit testing. Knowledge of hibernate and spring is useful but not required. Expected audience: Developers, technical project leaders and architects, who are into unit testing and want to improve testing on their projects.

This talk is about how to use the stresses of writing unit tests to improve your code. If I'm having trouble writing tests, it's often because the design of my target code can be improved. The trick is to listen to the tests and let them drive my development — that's a hint as to why it's called Test-Driven Development. As a developer, you can sensitise yourself to find the rough edges in your tests and use them for rapid feedback about how to improved the design of your code.
In this talk, I will work through examples of "smelly" tests, showing how they highlight design flaws and suggest improvements.

This session will compare a range of popular IoC containers. The containers that will be compared are: Spring, Guice, Tapestry 5 IOC, HK2
Summary Many Java developers have used a IoC container - or at least heard about Spring. Today there are a good number of IoC containers and each of them claiming to do Dependency Injection (DI) in a better way. This session will explain what IoC/DI really is, why we should use it, how the containers work and when to use each specific container. In this session, you will learn: * What Dependency Injection can add to your applications; * How various frameworks, including Spring, Guice, Tapestry 5 IOC, HK2 and PicoContainer, work; * Tips on when to use each specific container. Required experience Knowledge of an IoC container Expected audience People eager to know more about IoC containers

This presentation explores the challenges and solution patterns for managing data and compute tasks in scale-out environments. It is based on experiences with using a wide assortment of software solutions for compute and data management in scale-out environments, including newer scale-out technologies such as data grids and compute grids as well as getting the best results out of traditional database and messaging solutions.
In the past two years I presented the talks “The Top 10 Ways to Botch an Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application” and “The Top 10 Ways to Botch Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application Scalability and Reliability”. Now that people have plenty of expertise on how to botch their applications, I wanted to shift focus from anti-patterns to patterns. The "Top 10" theme remains as it keeps a quick pace and enforces a quick distillation of complex topics into simple concepts for the audience to remember. In this presentation I will use real world examples to demonstrate the challenges, solutions, and unexpected discoveries architects find when building scalable Java applications. I will site actual scenarios where each pattern has been used, and explain what the driving forces were behind these choices. (This talk consciously steers clear of discussing website scaling via content caching, as this is a topic well-covered by many whitepapers, presentations and other conferences. A few examples: For example, working on an ultra-low-latency JavaSpaces-based trading application was one of our first exposures to Recovery-Oriented Computing (ROC) for transaction processing in a production environment. The ROC concept can be used to achieve otherwise impossible results by selectively persisting only critical system state. Prior to this, we had generally steered clear of non-replicated in-memory data. But applying the ROC concept allowed us to achieve an order-of-magnitude latency improvement over what even the most efficient replicated-memory approach would have allowed, without compromising system availability. Likewise, working with a high-volume clearing application, a partner discovered that while serializable database isolation was required from a business perspective, and their database of choice enforced this optimistically, performing initial locking in-memory minimized the number of transaction rollbacks, substantially increasing system throughput. Much of this experience was acquired while working with customers in the usual early-adopter sectors: websites for retail, travel and hospitality; transaction processing and compute grids in investment banks; and more recently, the rush of so-called "Web 2.0" startups. While in most of these cases, the primary reason for being onsite with the customer was the Coherence product that I am involved with, many of the more interesting lessons came from working with 3rd party products from dozens of vendors and open source communities, and learning alternate solutions to common problems from the people involved with those products.

This experience report will cover how our maven project moved from one single line of code in one webapp module to five webapplications and fourteen modules. There are very few best practises regarding how to organize a maven project over time. After talking to several peers and reading all available material I have not found any good solutions to this. This presentation is my effort to give something back to the java community and hopefully start a discussionon how you should organize your maven projects. Keypoints: * What is the best way to keep buildtime down to a absolute minimum? * Should the modules be organized in vertical or horizontal modules? * How should you use a maven repository? * How do you handle releases * When should you create a new module? * What is the downsize of creating a new module?
* Introduction * How it all got started * What was the result of our first refactoring? * How did we use CI-servers? * How did we use the maven:release-plugin? * What other useful plugins did we use? * Where did we end up and what did we learn? * Q&A

Many developers find the user experience uninteresting. "It's easy. Just skip the interface design phase and make everything beige. You can't go wrong with beige", some might think. This presentation will look at the theory behind great user experience. We will cover and kill some myths, talk about conventions, intuition and user intentions, as we go through the "classification process model" and give an overview of the laws of interaction design.
As we go along, we will show a best practice case study; how two senior Swing developers and a usability specialist transformed good user experience principles into a successful photo editor. The Photo Editor is developed as part of the new version of the Escenic Content Studio CMS client. Content Studio is used daily by more than 400 media sites worldwide, with several thousand end users, and is tailored to support modern newspapers' online publishing routines. The goal was to create an intuitive, task-oriented photo editor that fulfills 95% of our typical users' needs. These tasks include correcting image orientation, crop for aspect or composition, simple image adjustments as well as obfuscating incriminating details.

Turnaround is the time it take for the changes in code to propagate to the running application. It includes build time, deploy time and initialization time. Recently some developments in the Java ecosystem and IDEs made it possible to develop software with zero turnaround. This talk is an overview of these developments, which include dynamic languages like Groovy, JavaScript and JRuby, framework support for reloading like Tapestry 5 and RIFE, module approach in OSGi and generic class reloading approaches like HotSwap, JavaRebel and FastSwap.With each approach we discuss benefits and limitations. We also review how to set up your build environment to get least possible turnaround whether you program legacy code or start from scratch.
* Intro [5m] * Dynamic languages [15m] * Modular approach [5m] * Framework reloading support [5m] * Class reloading [10m] ** HotSwap ** JavaRebel & FastSwap * Setting up your environment [10m] ** Exploded development ** Build cycle ** Symbolic links and junction points * Q&A [10m] Required experience Familiarity with the Java development cycle. As an overview talk the goal is to show the possible options rather than discuss each of them in depth. Expected audience Software engineers and architects who want to improve their development turnaround time. The talk is based on experience of decreasing development time of 150 developers to almost zero. A lot of that expirience can be directly transferred to you.

Engineer tools like the familiar IDEs (Eclipse/IDEA/NetBeans etc.) have user interfaces increasingly different from office tools like Microsoft Office. When creating applications for end users it is important to aim for the look and feel this group is comfortable with rather than what would be intuitive for the engineer. At Exie AS we have developed an open source Swing look and feel component that dramatically simplifies this task. Just as it is important to utilize frameworks to improve productivity when developing web-based solution, so is the case with rich clients/desktop applications. A significant part of a desktop application consists of UI and IO plumbing. When should various menus, buttons and tool bars be enabled? Flexible docking frameworks, user preferences etc. There are various RCP frameworks available, however for a Swing based client the NetBeans RCP is perhaps the most complete. How to create an NetBeans RCP client and make it look like a member of the Microsoft Office package? It is quite easy, and I am going to show you how.
* Introduction * The needs of an advanced rich client * The main components of the NetBeans RCP * The Office 2007 LAF OpenSource module * (Demo) Creating a simple distributed, Internet enabled RCP from scratch * Conclusions * Q&A

As you hang up the phone after talking to your wife, you know you have to prepare an important dinner. You're not really motivated, neither sure where to find the right ingredience. But in fear for your wife you never consider objecting. Some time later, almost forgetting the task, you head for the grocery store. Since you're no expert on cooking you ask for help. Heading back home you decide to call a couple of friends to help you - since you really have more important things to do. When your wife comes home she stops suddenly with a strange look on her face; "What!? I can't serve rabit! Did you forget that we are having The Animal Foundation?". I respond weakly; "They don't like animals?". "They don't like killing them, you idiot! This talk covers the challenges we meet from someone defines a strategy and approves developing an IT-system to when someone else actually starts implementing it. Most of these challenges do not require "rocket science", so why does it happen over and over again? To finish of Tom will also show us a totally different approach where companies can meet these challenges and save months and millions, keep momentum and committment and gain tons of value! NB! This talk should also be interesting for developers who hasn't been involved in the stages before implementation, since you're the one they'll blame at the end.
* Introducing a classic scenario - From strategy, through requirement specification to development. * The problems - What are we loosing along the way? * A different approach - It only works if it's important enough and we lean in. * Q & A Required experience: Experience from software development projects Expected audience: IT-managers, Project Managers, Technical Managers or other experienced people who have been involved somewhere in the process from where a strategy is defined to the implementation of the IT-system starts.

In the last several years, I've taken a different approach to building software applications. Implementing various application concerns(1) generically(2) has enabled me to reuse the implementations across projects. * (1) concerns: such as forms construction, validation, ui navigation, search, authorization * (2) generically: in such a fashion that the implementation is decoupled from, or agnostic from the application's domain Specifically, I have constructed a framework that enables a very high degree of reuse, whereby I reduce application development to little more than defining the domain. Where implementations of the persistence, user interface, and other concerns can be reused across differing applications. In this talk, I will be sharing with you my experiences with this approach, and the results it has yielded. Live demonstrations of the various reusable features will be given.
* Introduction (1 min) * What's wrong with the way we build software applications today? (5 mins) * The scaffolds we see in rails, grails, etc.. are the beginning (2 mins) * Decoupling concerns implementations from the domain = Freedom to reuse implementations across applications (1 min) * How to decouple the model: coupling to the metamodel (5 mins) * Demonstrating sample applications constructed in this fashion (5 mins) * Overview of Generic Implementations: * Generic Create, Read, Update, Delete (2 mins) * Deployment (5 mins) * Analysis of the results (5 mins) * Conclusions/References (1 min) * Q&A (5 mins) Language: English Level: Intermediate Required experience: Participants should have experience in designing and implementing business software solutions. Code examples will be given using the following specific tool stack: the Java programming language, the Swing GUI Toolkit, the Hibernate O/R Mapping framework, and Java reflection, metadata concepts. Expected audience: Please consider attending this session if you are either a developer or manager with interest in exploring ways to improve the current state of software applications development in the areas of: developer productivity, usability, software application maintainability.
Eitan Suez is an independent software developer, primarily known for developing a system for extremely agile software development by the name of JMatter (open source, GPL, see http://jmatter.org/ ).

Alternative languages like Ruby, Scala and Erlang are being picked up by the large platforms and getting ever more attention. Many feel the need to learn a new language, but how does one choose which "other" languages to learn and develop in when there are so many worthy contenders? Pythonistas have historically not been very good at marketing. This talk will attempt to convince you that Python/Jython/IronPython deserves to be part of your developer toolbox. Language design choices in syntax, features and semantics influence what areas a language is suited for and the community that grows around it. Particular features and idioms of Python will be introduced and compared to choices made by other relevant languages. Finally, a demonstration of how effective development in Python can be using the Django framework which has emerged as the premier Python web-framework.
* Introduction * Python & Ruby * Python & Erlang * Python & Scala * Django * Q&A Language: English Level: The talk will be introductory but aimed at developers. Required experience: Developer experience Expected Audience: People who are interested in programming languages to use beyond and alongside Java.

Standards make the world go round. It would be impossible to mail a package or send an email message, drive a car or take an airplane trip, shop for food in a supermarket, obtain medical treatment in a hospital, watch TV or movies, enjoy a sports game, or do any of the other things the modern world offers without standards.
The Java platform is built on standards, and its success is directly attributable to the community-driven process through which the language and platform evolve: the Java Community Process (JCP) program. The acceptance and success of open-source development methodologies pose both a challenge and an opportunity for the JCP program. Are standards necessary in an open-source world?

Get ready for a challenge as Robert Martin dives deep into the topic of clean Java code by examining what makes a good function.
In this talk we will look at a lot of code; some good and some bad. We will experience how such code is analyzed, critiqued, and eventually refactored. We will understand the decisions made by an expert in the field as bad code is gradually transformed into good code. How big should a function be? How should it be named? How should it be documented. How many indent levels should it have? How should it deal with exceptions, arguments, and return values. This talk is all about code at the lowest level. And yet the principles and techniques presented have far reaching implications.

Four years after the release of the Portlet 1.0 specification, the new Portlet 2.0 specification introduces many new features that will greatly improve the interactivity of portlet applications and portals. The specification introduces advanced coordination features such as portlet events standardizing inter portlet communication and public render parameters which allows several portlets to share the same render parameters. The new resource serving feature allows a portlet to deliver personalized resources to the browser such as images or PDF documents based on the current user preferences and profile, it also offers the capability to serve markup fragments from a portlet providing support for ajax portlet development. Portlets are now allowed to interact with the portal request and response with the possibility to read or write HTTP headers and insert markup elements to the head section of the portal page. Others important features such as enhanced content caching and portlet filtering have been also introduced in the specification.
* Short introduction (3mns) * Portal & Portlet 1.0 (10mns) ** explain the role of an enterprise portal in the ecosystem and the solution it provides ** portlet history and concepts: brief recap of the Portlet 1.0 specification, its history, limitations and place in the Java EE ecosystem; brief overview of portlet containers * New Portlet 2.0 features focusing on advanced portlet coordination and AJAX applications based on the resource serving feature. Other features are reviewed albeit in lesser detail. Each major feature is explained, introduced by use cases. Differences with Portlet 1.0 are examined when relevant. Features are then demonstrated to get the audience to efficiently understand the concepts. ** Coordination features: portlet events and portlet public render parameters ** AJAX portlets based on the resource serving feature: the resource serving feature and use case for implementing AJAX portlet are explained. Some AJAX use cases are not covered by the specification, we'll explain why the expert group did not provide support for such cases and possible scenarii to address the issue. ** Quick overview of other features: sticky request attributes, GenericPortlet improvements, header access, portlet filters and caching, etc... * Conclusion (2mns) * Q&A (10mns) Language: English Level: intermediate Required experience: Web application development skills are expected, portal or portlet experience is not mandatory. Expected audience: Developers that wants to create applications for portals using the Java EE platorm and leverage the new features of the Portlet 2.0 specification. Architects that want to build a portal using several Portlet applications based on the Portlet 2.0 specification. Attendees will learn about the new features provided by the Portlet 2.0 specification and how to leverage them in their Portlet applications.

One of the core principles of domain driven design is that it should be focused on the domain and it’s logic, rather than the technology used to implement the system. However, many projects using the domain driven approach get tangled up in the technicalities of software development which increases complexity, reduces velocity and hurts both maintainability and reusability. In this talk I will demonstrate how to employ software engineering principles like "Don’t Repeat Yourself" (DRY), the single responsibility principle, separation of concerns and many more to keep attention on the model and at the same time cater for the concerns that clutter the designs of many domain driven solutions. After attending this talk, you should have a better understanding of how to separate your infrastructural con- cerns from your domain logic, build adaptable domain models that fit into many usage scenarios and keep those models maintainable throughout the entire project life-cycle.
* Introduction. This section is just a brief introduction to the ensuing topics. ~2 minutes. * ΄When Patterns Become Anti-patterns‘. This section will show how we unconsciously collapse our ap- plication structures by using design patterns to increase flexibility and let rigidity creep in to our designs. ~5 minutes. * The Strategy Pattern. The Strategy pattern enables us to select algorithms at runtime, but this comes with at the cost of forcing classes to have knowledge about the contexts in which these algorithms are used. Focusing on the implementation of a commonly used pattern drives attention to- wards how we can implement the same pattern with different means, which will be one of the themes for the rest of the talk. * The Collapse of Application Structure. Our implementations of common design patterns causes a ΄pattern lock-in‘ that can fragment domain logic and blur out the distinction between domain and in- frastructure logic. This can hurt the maintainability of our applications. Making Roles Explicit. This section will focus on improving the design of a domain model’s internals to achieve better separation of concerns and improved flexibility and maintainability. ~15 minutes * Our Objects Play Too Many Roles. Our domain objects, especially Aggregates, often violate sound software engineering principles. The upside of this is that it gives developers using these a better experience, the downside is that it hurts maintainability. In this section I will show how the common validation patterns we use in our models violates the single responsibility principle and eschew domain concepts. * Refactoring to Explicit Roles. In this section I will show how to separate the concerns in the previ- ous section into domain objects and services that adhere to the single responsibility principle and makes the solution more extensible. * Data Access is Infrastructure. This section will focus on improving the architecture of an application by clearly distinguishing between domain logic and infrastructure code. Towards the end we connect the dots by combining the lessons from this section with the ones form the previous section. ~20 minutes * Don’t Repeat Yourself! In domain driven design we use Repositories to abstract the data access layer. Different Repositories often share the same behavior and their implementations often violate the DRY principle. In this section I will show how to refactor the repository concepts into an application’s supporting infrastructure to increase productivity, reusability and maintainability without sacrificing the flexibility of hand-rolled repositories. * Lazy About Lazy Loading. Repositories are commonly used in conjunction with object/relational mappers to increase separation of concerns. As the real-world concerns of software development manifest themselves, these abstractions start to leak and soon our domain services get tainted with fetching strategies and similar. In this section I will show how we can combine the concepts from previous sections with Inversion of Control to keep our models clean. * Wrap up. In this section the emphasis is on separation of concerns, the DRY-principle and the importance of keeping roles explicit. ~5 minutes Required experience Attendants should have at least a basic understanding of domain driven design to get full yield. The design principles and techniques presented are generally applicable, and can be of interest to attendants with out experiences with domain driven design. Expected audience This talk is directed towards developers and architects who practice or want to practice domain driven de- sign. It should also be of interest to domain driven design skeptics who feel that this practice bring too much complexity into their designs.

Dynamic languages and frameworks come in different shapes and forms but they all get attention from architects looking at providing application agility and better development speed while preserving the systemic qualities of more traditional runtimes (scalability, manageability, etc...)
The first step is to have the dynamic language run on the JVM to benefit from the HotSpot investment, the second one is to have the associated web framework take advantage of an application server infrastructure providing pooling, recycling and other monitoring services. With the advent of modular architectures at the heart of modern application servers, it becomes now possible de make the wealth of Java APIs and the benefits of such a runtime available to artifacts beyond J2EE/Java EE. This talk will cover the value of dynamic languages to augment the value of existing applications and how these are implemented on the new, modular, OSGi-based GlassFish v3 architecture. It will discuss the integration of JRuby on Rails, PHP, Groovy/Grails, Python/Django and maybe other dynamic technologies in GlassFish. Demos and a couple success stories included. The list of APIs available to scripting frameworks include (but are not limited to): * Metro (JAX-WS and advanced Web Services) * Java Persistence API * Grizzly Comet for Ajax Push * JBI/ESB integration * JMS/MQ connectivity * Connector integration Audience Java and scripting architects and developers. They will be able to see for themselves the value and the maturity of mixing a traditional application server approach with the agility provided by scripting languages and frameworks.

Are you writing code that never gets used? Are you struggling to make the code fit your requirements? Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is a fresh breath of air in the agile community, and its primary focus is to deliver software that matters. -For the end users. BDD builds upon several agile tools and practices like Acceptance-Test Driven Planning, Example-Driven Devlopment, FIT, User Stories and TDD, and bring them together in a consistent whole.
This presentation will give an introduction to the principles and practices of BDD and demonstrate how you can make your plain text User Stories executable with RSpec's Story Framework, running against Java code. The RSpec framework itself is written in Ruby, but JRuby makes it possible to make your stories run against applications written in Java.

For decades, enterprise systems have been built around the database - the original canonical data structure that everything had to integrate to. The DBA was the most powerful person in the enterprise, even messages standards were based on the database structures and it seemed everything had to have a table associated with it. The time has come to think about an enterprise free from the RDBMS - not free from persistence altogether, but free from the lock-in of the classic RDBMS. John will talk through some recent projects at several large financial institutions now building global trading systems without a database in sight.

What is internal quality and why are metrics helpful? A comparison with a cake will make it easy to understand: Not the optic and not the frosting on top of a cake guarantee a good taste and a healthy enjoyment. The ingredients, the recipe, the baking itself, the enjoyment of the cake, the great treat of it to keep in memory and the comfortable feeling afterwards are part of the total value and quality of the tasty cake. With the enjoyment of software is it likewise. The inner quality of software is crucial for your success in software development projects. This talk gives answers why this kind of quality is so important and how to gain better technical quality using different metrics based on the usage of the open source software XRadar (and others).
The quality of software can be divided into two parts. The first part is the outer quality, also known as functional quality. This is the quality seen by the user of the software. The second part is the internal quality, also known as technical quality. This is the quality seen by the software engineers. The testing of software is often only based on functional testing. Because the functional testing is driven by the functional requirements, the functional quality is easy to test and easy to measure. The technical part of the software is almost ignored, because the technical quality is harder to test. But the technical quality directly affects the functional quality. Sometimes you have non-functional requirements like response time for a certain function, but other non-functional requirements, like maintainability, are not measured. The talk will give the attendees ideas how to “test” or measure the technical quality of their software. I will give answers concerning basic questions on software quality, source code, object model, software metrics and their relationship. I will give a short introduction into basic terms and I will give a short overview on basic metrics and metrics on a higher, aggregated level. Then I will show some open source tools like PMD, ckjm, JDepend and will discuss the usage problems. Tools like SonarJ, Sonar and Xradar have more benefits. They consolidate the basic reports of the basic tools to create more readable and understandable reports of your software. The talk will have a focus on practical methods. I will also give examples based on daily project practice and the usage based on the open source tool XRadar (xradar.sourceforge.net). XRadar is a toolkit for quality analysis for java based software project. It is a reporting tool based on many other open source toolkits like PMD or JDepend.

The Applicaton Server is dead. But what about the Enterprise Service Bus? Are we facing phantom requirements and vendor-driven architecture all over again or does the ESB provide useful middleware services needed for enterprise development? Well, it depends on your requirements. In this talk we explore a real-world case and show how to implement a solution with and without an ESB. As it turns out, there are very good alternatives to typical ESB features. We consider pros and cons and present guidelines for the process of selecting the right tool for the job.
* Introduction * Features of an ESB * Case study: A system for collection, calculation and presentation of public pensions ** Overview of the functional and non-functional requirements of the system which has to integrate with numerous external systems. * A solution based on Mule 2.0 ** A message-oriented approach using transformations, aggregation, routing and other mechanisms supported by an ESB * A solution without an ESB ** A procedure-oriented approach using POJOs, Spring and other open source frameworks and libraries * Comparison of the solutions * Architectural guidelines * Summary Required experience: The attendants should have experience from development of enterprise applications.

Last November, Spring 2.5 was released. This version of Spring, the de-facto Java EE application platform marks the beginning of the introduction of alternative ways to configure components. In the, we've mainly focused on provided XML as the main language to perform Dependency Injection on object. Since 2.5, Spring has introduced several new ways to doing this. This session focuses on the various ways of using the Spring container to Dependency Inject objects such as the traditional <beans> XML language, the extensible namespaces, the @Autowired and @Component annotations, but also the innovative JavaConfig project that is capable of configuring Java objects using @Bean annotations. Each has drawbacks and advantages and this session will discuss which one you should choose in what scenario. After this code-intensive session, you will walk away with a clear understanding of when XML is a good choice for configuration and when to opt for one of the annotation-based options.
* Short introduction of myself * Short introduction of Dependency Injection as the general subject of the talk. There will be a lively, entertaining and mostly non-technical analogy for DI that will serve for thhe remainder of the talk * XML configuration option ** Introduction ** Demos ** Drawbacks, advantages, hints, tips and tricks * @Component/@Autowired configuration option ** Introduction ** Demos ** Drawbacks, advantages, hints, tips and tricks * @Bean/@Configuration option ** Introduction ** Demos ** Drawbacks, advantages, hints, tips and tricks * Comparison to other frameworks / DI approaches and conclusion The session is quite code intensive with relevant demos. Level: Anybody can join in, as it's entertaining even for those without Spring experience. For advanced users there's something to learn as well. Expected audience: Audience will leave with a clear understanding of Depedency Injection and the options Spring has to facilitate DI.

Given that object orientation underpins the Java language, it would be expected that anyone using Java would also know about OO. In one sense this is true, but there is more to effective modern object-oriented development than just creating a few objects and calling a few methods.
Many developers working in Java have not had the opportunity or exposure to effective object-oriented practice that would allow them to avoid common design pitfalls and to make more effective use of the language. Although object orientation is far from being a new approach (think Sergeant Pepper), and it's also far from being obscure, its mainstream adoption by programmers and programming languages alike is not always as effective as it could be, and sometimes the results can be less than desirable (to put it politely). This session aims to put a number of concepts many developers may be unsure of on a firmer footing, highlighting common pitfalls in OO practice -- such as abuse of inheritance, simplistic getter/setter interfaces, patternitis, use of singleton objects -- and emphasising techniques that promote an easier life -- such as loose coupling, unit testability, pattern-based design thinking, incremental and sufficient design.

The iLabs mobile toolbox is a an open source (Lesser Gnu Public License) java library for J2ME that makes it simple to make programs for social interaction on mobile phones.  The library is quite portable, since it abstracts away some of the notorious problem spots in J2ME programming: Keyboard handling, camera and sound handling.  It provides ready-made interfaces to Facebook, XMPP (Jabber), Blogger and other APIs necessary for social interaction.  The library includes a web browser library written entirely in J2ME that has proven extremely useful both for web browsing, and for user interface development when embedded in applications (clicking on an image on a "webpage" can for instance start a camera for image capturing). During the talk we will outline the anatomy of an application, the main elements of the library, and we will demonstrate how to build and deploy several small applications.
Required experience Some experience in program development. No experience necessary with neither ilabs Mobile Toolkit or J2ME. Some experience with use of social networking software an advantage (facebook, linkedin, orkut, or similar). Expected audience People with an interest in creating applications for mobile phones, either as developers (primary focus), or with ideas for mobile apps who need to know about things that are now simple to do using J2ME. After the talk developers will be able to start developing J2ME applications using the iLabs mobile toolbox, people with ideas will know that some of their ideas may be feasible within a reasonable amount of development work.

With the emergence of Web Services and the evolution of WS-* standards, the enterprise application integration vendors were quick to realise their traditional business model was under threat. On the back of their large installed bases, vendor products were offered to customers to help them deploy and manage their attempts to develop Service Oriented Architectures, with the implication that Web Services were of little use without additional middleware to deal with their alleged inherent complexity.
In this talk Jim will discuss how protocol-centric approaches like Web Services or the RESTful styles can constitute a robust integration fabric, providing the same benefits as proprietary middleware without vendor lock-in, and show how incremental, endpoint-centric integration is a viable strategy for enterprise service-oriented systems. * Historical perspective of EAI * Enterprise Architecture Today * Deploying an ESB * Enterprise architecture medium, long term * Spaghetti Oriented Architecture * Using commodity integration * Web Services example * Aiming for high cohesion with loose coupling * Arriving at SOA Required experience Participants in this session should be aware of general SOA concepts such as services and buses. Architecture experience is useful, but not necessary. Expected audience Architects and developers with an interest in SOA and enterprise architecture. No technical pre-requisites are necessary, but a sense of optimism, fun, and open-mindedness would be useful.

Many view Apache Maven in the context of other build tools such as Apache Ant and Apache Ivy, yet Maven’s functionalities extend far beyond the efficient, enterprise-class project build. When coupled with supporting tools like Nexus and m2eclipse, Maven starts to accelerate development by reducing the level of work required to support build management and cross-department collaboration.
In this talk, Jason van Zyl, founder of Sonatype and creator of Maven’s Central Repository, will present a constellation of open-source software which can be used to extend Maven’s capabilities, from next-generation Eclipse support provided by m2eclipse to the Nexus Maven Repository Manager and Hudson which offer Maven support. Jason will also introduce some of the more unexpected uses of Maven to support development with Flex and to support the publishing industry

Modularity, versioning and dynamics make OSGi an ideal candidate for deploying and running Java applications, whether small or large. However, nothing comes for free and, like in any other environment, there are "do"s and "don't"s. In this session, we'll start by looking at OSGi (plus HK2 and JAM while we're at it) and then focus on some of the challenges that one might encounter when developing an enterprise application (containing web and data tier) in OSGi and how they can be addressed, using the lessons learned in Spring Dynamic Modules project and SpringSource Application Platform.
* OSGi overview * Part 1: OSGi class and resource loading * Persistence * Part 2: Working with OSGi services * Summary * Q&A Required experience: * Basic OSGi, persistence and web knowledge * Good Spring knowledge * Good Java Class/Class Loading knowledge Expected audience: Anybody interested in using OSGi for enterprise applications

Over the past years, successful practitioners have applied Agile methods like Scrum and eXtreme Programming (XP) on individual projects to cut development lead times, improve product quality and reduce engineering cost. For instance, time-to-market reductions in the range of 30-50% have been reported by leading companies. Now, as these practitioners seek to expand on their initial successes, they face many complex obstacles posed by the realities of today's business environment: multiple organizational silos, distributed teams, interfacing with 'non-agile' vendors and customer organizations, continued cost cutting, complex product suites, and the pressing need for innovation. How can agile practitioners apply the fundamental tenets of Agile - integrated small teams, small releases, sufficient-to-purpose, etc - to provide the next round of significant returns from their Agile investment? Sanjiv Augustine of LitheSpeed will lead a discussion on adopting a philosophy of smallness within bigness to allow the scaling of Agile practices beyond individual projects to deliver process improvements in complex environments with multiple projects.

Quercus is Caucho Technology's 100% Java implementation of PHP. This technology is taking off not only because of the trend toward scripting in the Java community, but also because of the performance and reliability that Java adds to PHP. In this talk, we will present the compelling reasons to use PHP on Java including availability of applications, ease of view development, and performance improvements of upto 89% over PHP with APC. We will show specific use cases of Quercus such as using popular PHP applications like MediaWiki, WordPress, and Drupal directly, bridging existing Java and PHP applications, and using PHP as a view technology for Java. We will also show the unique capabilities of the Quercus implementation such as transparent clustered sessions and use of Java objects natively from PHP. Finally, we will look at case studies of real Quercus deployments such as LiveProcess, the leader in emergency preparedness' planning for the healthcare industry, and others to see how these applications take advantage of PHP on Java.

Our application runs over 10,000 sustained transactions per second with a rich model. The key? Modeling state transitions explicitly.
Our application runs over 10,000 sustained transactions per second with a rich model. The key? Modeling state transitions explicitly. In today's world many systems have non-functional requirements that prevent them from being single database centric. This presentation looks at how Domain Driven Design can fit into such environments including extremely large scale web sites, batch processing, and even using highly scalable backing stores such as CouchDb or HyperTable. Event streams, a different way of storing the current state of an object, open many doors in this session not only in how we scale and store our domain but also in how we rationalize about it.

A unique view of the world of high finance, with a technical slant. Connecting to stock exchanges with Java FIX engines, automated and algorithmic trading, back testing with over peta-byte of price ticks stored in a cloud and running it all from your mobile phone.
A year ago it was difficult to believe that there would be anything left in the financial services industry, banks were disappearing faster than glaciers and everything looked uncertain. A year on and banks are making profits again, Europe is slowly emerging form the recession and it's almost business as usual. One thing that hasn't changed over the last few years though is the onslaught of technology and our reliance on it to create and drive business. John will talk about the foreign-exchange, derivatives, equity and commodity exchanges, from the New York Stock exchange and InterContinental Exchange to the Deutsche Börse and Saudi Exchange. How FIX engines, written in C, Java and .NET work and how they relay the prices, thousands per second to the traders and algorithmic trading engines. Order Management Systems and Order Execution Engines then send the buy and sell order back to the exchange completing the loop. This talk will be on the technologies used, the problems faced and solutions to some of the problems, sticking mainly to the Java side of the stack but explaining why and where the other technologies fit in. John will also go into some of the leading edge technologies which include storing historic data in the cloud, around a peta-byte and then processing the data for algorithmic back-testing. Finally a look into how the mobile phone technologies are making a big hit in this area, applications being so valuable that the phone can be thrown in with the software. This will be a technical talk from an architects point of view, some code will be shown to demonstrate FIX connectivity and iPhone workings but talk with my more on the technologies and the architecture than the details of the code.

How to use DDD principles to make better strategic design decisions
As software development leaders, we need to think more strategically. Some design decisions affect the trajectory of the whole project or even the organization. These decisions arise in early chartering and throughout development, and they are about much more than architecture. This talk will examine these issues through the lens of the Strategic Design principles of domain-driven design, which systematize a few critical practices some successful teams do intuitively. It is common for skilled teams to deliver software they are not proud of, due to compromises with legacy designs. Others toil for years, producing a platform that is never used to good advantage. These are strategic failures. On the other hand, there are projects with a direct explanation of how the software contributes to business goals. There are projects where designers work with a realistic view of the context of their development within the larger system, allowing them to maintain design clarity and integrity. These are strategic successes. Winning strategy starts with the domain. Two domain-driven design principles, "Context Mapping" and "Distilling the Core Domain", help you see your strategic situation more clearly and approach strategic design decisions more systematically. These techniques require extensive interaction with domain experts as well as the leaders of the organization, in discussions broader than functional requirements. They sometimes lead to priorities quite different from our most comfortable notions.
Eric Evans, author of Domain-driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, is a thought leader in software design, domain driven design and domain modeling and particularly focuses on strategic design.

A relevant example of a BPM-driven Web-shop application that makes use of ”Second Life” (Massive Online Virtual World) to demonstrate the handling of human tasks.
Almost everyone has heard mention of the term Business Process Management (BPM), but so few know what it's all about - and even less make use of BPM systems in their projects. As a paradox, a vast amount of Java-based projects actually implement BPM-functionality into their systems without even considering using ready-made BPM products, or simply because the architects are ignorant of the purpose of such systems. A part of the problem is that BPM vendors tend to over-simplify their white-paper examples, which lead to potential users finding it difficult to relate the provided examples to their specific problems. In this presentation a Web-shop application will be designed using a BPM-system (jBPM in this case) as a fundamental part of the overall architecture. Unreliable human-tasks will be demonstrated using ”Second Life”, which is a Massive Online Virtual World. Changing business rules, scheduling and user assignments will all be provided by the BPM-system and not implemented as part of the application (which, sadly, is the common way to do it). This presentation will provide the audience with a clean example of using BPM in their application that is more relevant than examples provided by vendors. In addition, the ”Second Life”-driven human-tasks will demonstrate how a BPM-based system will work in a (near) real-life situation.

GlassFish v3 modular and service architecture using OSGi and HK2. Developer features, both from Java EE 6 and product perspective. Demos.
This is certainly interesting times for application servers in general and for GlassFish in particular. This session will discuss GlassFish v3 and Java EE 6 which will both be weeks if not days away from being declared final at the time of the JavaZone conference. It will cover what's new with the technology and product but also with the community work. GlassFish is not only a modular application server platform with its core built on top of OSGi (it ships with Felix but also runs on multiple OSGi implementations), it also has a unique non-intrusive and extensible architecture. In essence, GlassFish is all about choice: Felix or Equinox, NetBeans or Eclipse (there are now GlassFish bundles with both Eclipse and NetBeans), and your choice of modules, all dynamically loaded. The resulting product ranges from extremely lightweight to extremely powerful. Choice doesn't stop at the Java EE frontier. The update center feature in the product also offers a powerful way to manage existing modules and access new ones from multiple repositories. It enables developers and companies to deal effectively with multiple frameworks, libraries and applications available from a simple graphical and command-line interface. Java EE 6 has many things going for it: new features (JAX-RS and JSR 299), important enhancements to existing well accepted technologies such as Servlet 3.0, JPA 2.0, EJB 3.1, and JSF 2.0, but also a web profile. With changing landscapes in a company or more broadly in the industry, the value of betting on a standard is higher than ever. Java EE 6 is improving the platform while taking into account what enterprise developers ask for: low barrier to access, maintainable applications, and yet infinite architectural solutions.
Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine is a member of the GlassFish team and has been acting as the ambassador for the project for the past two years. Alexis is a former speaker at JavaZone 2007/2008 and CommunityOne North 2009 is Oslo and has some NOK's left over from previous traveling he'd like to spend.

guardian.co.uk is the three times winner of the Webby for best newspaper on the web (http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/may/05/guardian-wins-three-webby-awards) and the UK's most popular newspaper website, with over 220 million page impressions a month. Over the past three years the platform driving the site has been almost completely rebuilt, by a team that at its peak numbered 104, with the principles of DDD at the heart of the design.
This presentation reviews how key evolutions of our model were driven by domain experts and how DDD encouraged them to have greater investment in the development process. It also discusses some low-tech practices and tools which helped the design and implementation of the model and some of the remaining challenges we face in maintaining a deep, malleable domain model, whilst still meeting deadlines and addressing the operational needs of the business.
Phil Wills has experience with a broad range of languages and technologies, but has spent the past three years focussing on redeveloping guardian.co.uk with a focus on building a strong domain model and achieving high performance.

Attendees will see how to use of uncertainty as a driver in development, both in terms of schedule and in terms of how to partition their code.
In software development a lack of certainty about something can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. This point of view can, however, seem a little counterintuitive and more than a little disturbing. There is a strong tendency for humans to feel unsure about uncertainty, in two minds over ambiguity and a little wobbly with instability. Whether over technology choice, implementation options, requirements or schedule, uncertainty is normally seen as something you must either suppress or avoid. Of this many people appear, well, certain. That you should embrace it and use it to help determine schedule and design is not immediately obvious. This session looks at how uncertainty can be employed in planning and used constructively to help determine object encapsulation, class hierarchy design and package partitioning.

This talk will briefly cover the process and tooling changes that have occured in the Maven project in order to accomplish what we have done with Maven 3.0, as well as discuss the architectural and feature changes. Some of the process changes include setting up a multi-platform Hudson grid, building out a framework of over 440 integration tests, creating integration tests for all core Maven plugins, and systematically seeking out Maven 2.x OSS projects to validate Maven 3.x's compatibility. We also built out a framework that measures disk I/O, network I/O, memory consumption, and CPU utilization to ensure that performance doesn't degrade. The architectural changes that will be discussed will center around how POMs are constructed, how the lifecycle is executed, how the plugin manager executes, and how artifacts are resolved. Some features derived from these architectural changes include any-source POMs, versionless parent elements, a compositional form of Maven POM configuration we call mixins, lifecycle extension points, plugin extension points, and our new Jetty Client-based, single point of entry artifact resolution mechanism we call the repository system

Learn how to implement Enterprise Integration patterns with Spring.
The Spring Integration project provides a natural extension to the Spring programming model to support many of the Enterprise Integration Patterns described in the book of the same name. The components are configured with either annotations or XML and are managed within any Spring Application Context. Therefore, Spring Integration is very easy to adopt incrementally within an existing Spring-based application, and there are no additional deployment requirements. In this demo-driven session, we will begin with a sample application that includes a preexisting service layer. We will proceed to enhance the application while maintaining a clean separation of concerns between the integration responsibilities and the business logic within that service layer. The integration components will include Polling Consumers, Content-Based Routers, Splitters, Transformers, Service Activators, and more. We will also explore Channel Adapters and Messaging Gateways to connect to different systems using Spring Integration's support for JMS, Mail, and File-based transports.

The history of computer programming has been bridging the gap between what the user says and what the programming language requires you to say. Building Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) allow you to express the solution in the language of the domain user instead of the language of the programmer.
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." (Leonardo da Vinci) The history of computer programming has been bridging the gap between what the user says ("We need to add sales tax to each item in the order") and what the programming language requires you to say ("for Iterator i = orderList.iterator();"). Building Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) allow you to express the solution in the language of the domain user instead of the language of the programmer. DSLs can be written in any programming language, but the more flexible the programming language used, the closer to plain English the DSL can be. Groovy is a dynamic language for the Java platform that is ideally suited for creating DSLs. Come see how Groovy can leverage the power of Java in a way that your users might actually be able to read and understand.

How do you get more done with less? By Automating with Hudson! This talk discusses this popular open-source CI system.
This talk will introduce Hudson, an open-source continuous integration (CI) system, which improves the productivity of a development team by automating various things. CI is getting adopted more and more, as computers get cheaper and more capable. For people new to Hudson, we'll walk through the main features, discuss why CI matters, and how Hudson can use a large number of computers effectively. For those who already know Hudson, we'll talk about the current state of the project and the community, as well as what the future directions are.

This session shows the 4 principles of developer productivity: acceleration, automation, focus, and canonicality, with examples of each.
In The Productive Programmer, I identify 4 principles of productivity: acceleration, focus, automation, and canonicality. This session defines the principles and describes their use, but the primary focus of this talk is on real-world examples of how you can use these principles to make yourself a more productive programmer. Acceleration covers ways to speed up development by taking command of your computer. This includes keyboard shortcuts (including ways to learn them and make better use of them) in both IntelliJ and Eclipse. Focus describes how you can utilize your environment (both physical and computer) to greatly enhance your productivity. Canonicality (the DRY principle from The Pragmatic Programmer) discourages repeating artifacts in projects. This talk shows effective ways to avoid this repetition. I show examples of creating DRY documentation, O/R mapping, database schemas, and development environments.Automation refers to making the computer do more work for you. This talk includes tons of examples, all culled from real-world projects

Come see why people rave about Ruby (including JRuby). This talk highlights the incredible power of meta-programming in JRuby.
This session shows one of the reasons that JRuby is the most powerful mainstream language today: meta-programming. It shows tons of meta-programming techniques in Ruby, including open classes, the shadow meta-class, defining methods on the fly, why Spring doesn't exist in Ruby, building annotations in JRuby, replicating Java features in JRuby, and tons more. And each of these comes with an example that actually makes sense!

Why stop when the fun is just getting started? A presentation on how healthy agile principles and techniques should prevail through the entire life cycle of an application; development, production and application management. By keeping your eye on the ball - the business overall strategy and visions, the application management phase can become an arena for realizing values and driving the business.
Why stop when the fun is just getting started? A typical phenomenon in IT-projects is how all projects seem to lose focus and momentum as soon as the system reaches production. The team is dispersed. New and often inexperienced personnel take over. Why does this happen? Would you stop nurturing and developing your newborn child? Application Management is often synonym to bug fixing and maintenance - and boring. It’s like in a hospital where it's all about keeping the patient alive, not helping them. While it of course is important to keep the patient alive, the point is that we should be focusing on improving the system. The system has finally reached a phase where you can get real feedback and adjust to reach your business goals. We will look into how healthy agile principles and techniques should prevail through development, into production and thus Application Management. Keep up the good iterative momentum! The goals of the application are still valid and shouldn't disappear. Instead one should embrace the fact that the application now is in a phase where it can collect real feedback. Understand the business' overall strategy and visions, and make sure to measure how you're doing according to these. Make the application management phase an arena for realizing values and driving the business forward. Dare to aim for the stars! It's time to create real value in the real world...

A very common problem when the shit hit’s the application fan and the debugging starts is that the logs are not in the correct format, the logging is too coarse-grained, and that the logs are hard to get runtime access to. This presentation will address this by first give you an overview of Log4j, show you how can control Log4j remotely using JMX, customizing the log output, and do remote logging.
When developing real-world applications, debugging can be quite cumbersome; the logging is at a level that doesn’t give you a clue of what’s going on, the log file is hard to retrieve and monitor, and you are not able filter out what is important for you. Typically an application restart is needed to change the logging level. And guess what, the buggy state of your application has disappeared as free beer at PartyZone, and your logs are flooded with unrelated information We have met these challenges several times when we at TANDBERG develop Java based products, and especially when we are designing clustered applications. Then it can be rally hard to determine which instance of the cluster that serves the incoming request. Collecting the logs from the instances in a centralized Syslog server, and apply filtering to get relevant information dynamically is very helpful for us when debugging these kind of applications. This presentation will provide the tools that make you able to dynamically change the log level remotely, redirect you logs to a centralized Syslog server, and filter log messages. In addition you will be shown working code examples of how to customize Log4j and instrument your application using JMX. All this will be achieved by using a killer combo of Log4j, Spring, and JMX presented to you as live and kicking code. The presentation will also give you an overview of the relevant mechanics in Log4j, Spring and JMX that makes the foundation of the example code in the session. The presented material is based on personal experiences from real-world Java products development.

So your server is having issues? memory? connections? limited response? Is the first solution to bounce the server? Today's Java™ 6 provides superior runtime monitoring and management capabilities. Learn the skills and tools necessary to debugging production JVM issues.
So your server is having issues? Memory? Connections? Limited response? Is the first solution to bounce the server? Perhaps change some VM flags or add some logging? In today's Java™ 6 technology world, with its superior run-time monitoring and management capabilities, the reasons to bounce the server have been greatly reduced. With proper Java Management Extensions instrumentation, the need to bounce the server may be eliminated for all but the rarest of cases. This session, for all Java technology developers and administrators, looks at the Java 6 platform's monitoring and management capabilities, which include the ability to make VM argument changes on the fly. In addition to what is provided in the JDK™ software, it demonstrates several management tools that are available at no cost. The session dives deeply into * jconsole - for memory monitoring, heap dumping, and thread analysis * JVM tools - jmap, jhat, jinfo, jstack * BTrace - the open-source option for on-the-fly monitoring of the JVM machine

A pragmatic and practical session on how to use Scala in the real world.
Scala is a one of the most interesting new languages for the JVM. A unique and elegant blend of the Object-Oriented (OO) and Functional Programming (FP) paradigms yet pragmatic and practical with seamless interoperability with Java. Scala stands for 'SCAlable LAnguage' and is designed to scale with the needs and requirements of its users. It is statically typed but with good type erasure and style which gives it a dynamic feel similar to Ruby or Python, but with the performance and safety only a statically typed language can provide. This makes it great for a wide range of use-cases, from internal DSLs to large-scale enterprise applications or container code. In this talk we will give you an introduction to Scala from a Java/JEE and real-world perspective. We will discuss a wide range of areas such as: * How to make effective use of Scala's richer OO abstractions and type system, such as mixin composition, to create more flexible and reusable components and systems. * How to take advantage of Scala's FP nature, such as closures, high-order functions, immutability, for more clean, safe, conceptually coherent and deterministic code. * How to make concurrent programming and event-driven systems a walk in the park using Scala's Actors library. * How to bring it all together and make Scala work in the real world; with problems like Web development, O/R Mapping, Dependency Injection (DI), AOP, Testing, High-Availability, Scale-Out etc.

The theories of Frederick Taylor and those that followed today still sets the norm for how organizations are managed. What we see as normal and common ways to organize work is in fact making agile adoption difficult, hindering empirical processes and self organizing teams.
* Why do we separate Java and .Net developers? * Why do system architects choose frameworks and write UML diagrams but do not write any code? * Why do we measure how many lines of code a developer writes? * Why is agile adoption in traditional organizations hard? The theories of Frederick Taylor and those that followed today still sets the norm for how organizations are managed. What we see as normal and common ways to organize work is in fact making agile adoption difficult, hindering empirical processes and self organizing teams. The talk points these patterns and their effects and shows how to avoid the to not miss the benefits of an agile development process.

Cloud computing have received a lot of attention the last couple years for being the next generation IT infrastructure. We'll look at what are the characteristics for a cloud-enabled application, how data grids work and then dig into why these two technologies are such a great match.
Cloud computing have become the new buzz word and must have for all CTO's, but there's rarely consensus about what it really is and how it can be made accessible by most organizations out there. Usually this term is used in conjunction with names like Salesforce.com, Google or Amazon EC2 and each of these companies deliver this kind of services, but in very different ways. This presentation will start off looking at typical characteristics of a cloud environment and what business value organizations try to get by moving in that direction, either through cloud-providers or by building their own private clouds. We'll then dive into typical characteristics of a cloud environment to see what's different and the see what characteristics a cloud enabled application get in a that kind of environment. It's not always straight forward to take a Java EE application and get it running in a cloud-enabled environment. We'll therefore be going through some challenges that you may face when deploying in a cloud environment and look at different ways to get around that. Finally we'll go back to some of the business requirements mentioned earlier and see to what degree a cloud environment is needed for that?

In this presentation, we provide a glimpse on the advances that have been booked by the software engineering research community for analyzing code smells and discuss some empirical results from studies on refactoring strategies. Our aim is to give developers and architects useful insights for prioritizing refactoring tasks and suggest different ways of combining source code analysis and human evaluation for supporting software evolution in their daily work.
Who hasn’t been confronted with the famous “spaghetti code” characteristic that occurs so often in projects that have undergone years of development? Such types of code are typically hard to understand and maintain, and could scale-up to the system level, leading to a phenomenon we call “software entropy” or “code decay”. Most of the work done by software developers is concerned with extending and enhancing existing systems rather than producing new systems (see [1,2,3]). Software entropy seriously hinders these activities, which can substantially increase the total project costs, thus it has become an important area of concern for many software architects and managers. To address this issue, companies have increased their focus on evaluating and improving maintainability of the code base. For example, Microsoft’s Office division assigned 20% of its development effort to re-develop/modify the code basis of their products [4]. A typical way to evaluate maintainability is to use code metrics to measure characteristics of the system. However, the problem with metrics is that they are hard to interpret and they do not provide clear guidance for improving the quality (What does a Cyclomatic Complexity of 342 mean? What can I do to improve this number?). With the increasing adoption of agile development methods, practices like refactoring [5] and the use of code smells [6] for source code analysis have become popular in pursuit of the holy grail of producing “beautiful code”. In general, these practices support software evolution and improve maintainability. However, not all refactorings pay-off in all situations and not all code smells are as “smelly” as one may think. Architects and developers still face the challenge of making redesign and refactoring decisions based on questions like: Which are the worst code-smells we need to get rid of? Which are the less risky refactorings? How can we do more “smart” and cost-effective refactoring? Are these notions built over code smells just a myth in order to achieve the beautiful code or do they really have practical consequences? In this presentation, we provide a glimpse on the advances that have been booked by the software engineering research community for analyzing code smells and discuss some empirical results from studies on refactoring strategies. Our aim is to give developers and architects useful insights for prioritizing refactoring tasks and suggest different ways of combining source code analysis and human evaluation for supporting software evolution in their daily work.

The "lizard brain" is the oldest part of the human brain -- the part responsible for autonomic functions like breathing, heart rate, and navigating websites. OK, maybe not that last part, but your website should be easy to use. Stupid easy. Lizard brain easy.
"There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone." (Bjarne Stroustrup) The "lizard brain" is the oldest part of the human brain -- the part responsible for autonomic functions like breathing, heart rate, and navigating websites. OK, maybe not that last part, but your website should be easy to use. Stupid easy. Lizard brain easy. Any time your user spends figuring out how to do something -- even for a split second -- is wasted time due to poor design. Inspired by Steve Krug's book "Don't Make Me Think", this talk answers the question, "Why is that website so hard to use?" In this talk, we look at what make a "good" website "good". Simple changes in the layout or sort order can yield drastic improvements. We'll get inside the heads of typical users and see how their view of our website is drastically different than what we painstakingly planned out. You'll learn how to cater to "Browsers" and "Searchers" -- the human kind, not the software kind. "Lizard Brain Web Design" answers these questions and more in a funny and informative way.

Performance testing is important, so we want to do it as often as possible. Over the lifetime of an application the performance of it will change and it's important to be aware of these changes. In this talk, we will demonstrate what kind of benefits continuous performance testing will give your project using Grinder, Hudson and Amazon Web Services.
Performance is always an important aspect to consider when developing Java applications. In many cases the performance testing is done late in the project when the programming is finished, something that might be a problem if performance issues are discovered. It is a better approach to monitor performance from the beginning of the project and continuously compare performance numbers between each build of the application, thus ensuring that the application has the wanted throughput right from the beginning. Using Hudson (http://hudson.dev.java.net/) and The Grinder (http://grinder.sf.net/) we have written a small plugin to run performance tests regularly and compare the results in graphs and tables. This talk will demonstrate how it is possible to continuously monitor the performance of any Java application, not just web applications, with a few simple steps. We will also demonstrate how to use Cloud Computing (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2) to distribute the performance tests. Using Cloud Computing is a relatively cheap and quick way to dynamically allocate a number of test-nodes in order to create as realistic test scenarios as possible.

In this session we'll take a tour of the Java class loading mechanism, both from JVM and developer point of view. We'll see how different delegation systems are built, how synchronization works, what is the difference between finding classes and resources, what wrong assumptions has been made and are now supported.
Class loaders are at the core of the Java language. Java EE containers, OSGi, NetBeans modules, Tapestry 5, Grails and many others use class loaders heavily. Yet when something would go wrong, would you know how to solve it? In this session we'll take a tour of the Java class loading mechanism, both from JVM and developer point of view. We'll see how different delegation systems are built, how synchronization works, what is the difference between finding classes and resources, what wrong assumptions has been made and are now supported. Next we will look at typical problems that you get with class loading and how to solve them. ClassNotFoundException, ClassNoDefError, LinkageError and many others are symptoms of specific things going wrong that you can usually find and fix. We'll review ways to fight with JAR hell and JAR locking and caching. Finally we'll take a look at things in the class loader world that are broken beyond repair and how to recognize and work around them.

Most web applications need integration capabilities but don't need the complexity of an ESB solution. Typically, web apps need a simple solution for performing common integration tasks such as receiving and sending messages over Email, JMS, FTP, calling a Web Service or REST services such as Facebook or Twitter. This talk will introduce Mule iBeans, a new integration framework specifically for Web Application integration. Mule iBeans focuses on task-based integration without introducing new complexities or architecture considerations.
The ESB is not well suited for simple Web Application integration. The Web application model has evolved to the point where the presentation/logic/data tier model is a bit limited since applications need to be connected to other applications and services. There are lots of ESB-type solutions out there for dealing with this shift but they often introduce new complexities or concepts that create a barrier to entry. This talk will provide working knowledge of how to hook in external services to your Web Application without the complexity. This session will introduce a new framework, Mule iBeans that focuses on task-based integration for web applications. The audience will learn how to integrate their web applications with other applications and services on the web and the enterprise in a way that doesn't add complexity to the code or architecture of the application. Using a couple of simple constructs developers will be able to integrate with services such as Flickr, JMS, Twitter, Google Maps and Email in minutes.
Ross Mason is Founder and CTO of MuleSource, Inc., and the creator of the open source Mule integration platform. Mason founded the Mule project in 2003 with the ideal to simplify the process of building application integration and ESBs that had been made overly complex by the commercial vendors.

Rules engines are getting a huge footprint in the market, and for certain areas they are a good match. Should you let a rules engine rule your application?
Rules engines are a hot topic in many large and small projects. When faced with the decision to choose either a rules engine, or to choose a rules engine at all there are many considerations to make. This talk will draw a line between what's real and what's perceived benefits of rules engines. When faced with the decision it will help you choose between rolling your own domain logic, or a rules engine. We will outline what impacts the choice of using a rules engine has on your project, and what implications it has to areas such as development, testing and architecture. Further on we will draw the line between domain logic and rules, and give criteria for when to choose one over the other. Topics that will be discussed: * Do we need a rules engine just because we have rules? * What are the drawbacks and benefits of using a rules engine? * Are the benefits real or perceived? This talk will bring together experiences from several large and small projects using rules engines. Some of them are amongst the largest projects in Norway that are currently implementing a rules engine based solution.

Companies that don´t innovate die, and most innovations fail. How can the theories behind Open Innovation help us make the most out of existing inventions and combine them with appropriate business models to create profitable businesses?
Many great companies fail to understand technological change and how it might affect them. Their current customers and existing business models that have served them so well in the past can turn into a curse in the light of disruptive innovation. Moving from closed to open innovation will help companies to get the most out of both their own inventions and the inventions of others as well. Can companies remain innovative over time?

Instead of building on top of low level abstractions, Qi4j starts at the business value, business modeling and solves the technology stack from top to bottom. No rock is left unturned, and exciting new modeling discoveries have been made along the journey. In this presentation we will cover the Persistence approach, how Qi4j is capable of decoupling the domain model from the underlying persistence system, able to swap persistence without change of code, able to express queries in Java without depending on the underlying query language, and how long-running "Unit Of Work" is superior to database transactions when it comes to domain modeling.

This session will explore how to use Java, JavaFX and the remote control from a Nintendo Wii to drive some strange and unusual user interfaces.
The Nintendo Wii has changed the way many people perceive computer games, shifting from the traditional console to a more natural, physically interactive experience. To achieve this, the Wii includes an innovative remote control (or Wiimote). To provide control of an on-screen cursor, the Wiimote has a special camera that can track up to four points of infrared light and report their positions in real time. This session explores how the Wiimote can be used in ways not originally intended by the Wii designers. Example applications keep the Wiimote stationary and use it to track moving infrared LEDs, which can be mounted on a pen, a screen, or even an umbrella. Data about the position of the infrared lights can be used to control the position of images so they are always projected on a screen or to provide a virtual whiteboard environment. The demonstrations use JSR 82 (Java™ APIs for Bluetooth), the WiiremoteJ open-source API, a Java platform library, and JavaFX™ code to drive the user interface. The session shows how JavaFX technology really is, "for all the screens of your life", including ones you've never thought of.

Is your code perfectly decoupled, reusable and generic? Maybe it shouldn't be. In this example-driven talk, we strike a blow for simplicity. We take to task current notions of high-quality software architecture and show how even modern approaches are needlessly complex.
Reuse, genericity and decoupling have recently been treated as the very goals of software development. But they are not. You probably feel you should reuse as much code as possible, be it your own, that of you organization or third party open source or commercial software. But just because the code is already written doesn't mean you won't have to understand, debug and maybe even change it. You probably feel you should write your code in a generic fashion so it can be reused. But generic code can be harder to understand. And making a piece of code flexible to certain kinds of changes will make it less flexible to other changes. Moving decisions to configuration can make your code more generic, but often, it will increase the cost of change. You have probably learned that you must reduce the extent to which parts of your code is coupled to each other if you are to create maintainable code. So all your objects reference each other through interfaces and are wired together in huge XML files. But this makes the code harder to navigate and refactor. In the quest for better software reuse, genericity and decoupling has become ends in themselves. In this talk, we will show how examples of how contemporary notions of good design have led us and others to solutions that are overly complex. "A good design" is not a goal in itself. The goal is a system that requires as little effort as possible to develop and change. Proper use of reuse, decoupling and genericity can help with this goal. Improper use almost always hurts. So how do you measure something like simplicity? We would like to revive an often reviled metric: Lines of code. More specifically, how many executable statements do you have to deal with to maintain the code? Software developers have to be smart. But if you sometimes get the feeling we're too smart for our own good, this talk is for you.

Learn how to persist large and rich domain models in a performant and scalable way
The tenets of Domain-Driven Design are well documented, and its mindshare has expanded massively in recent years, due to the brilliant work of Eric Evans and others. However, knowledge on persisting large and rich domain models, especially in a performant and scalable way, is basically non existing. Lessons learned by architects of high-scale DDD/OO-based systems in production settings are largely absent from the professional literature. And yet such knowledge should be of significant value to current practitioners responsible for the development or operation of such systems with performance and scalability concerns. Therefore this seminar talk will focus on the persistence of domain models, the typical problems that arise around performance, scalability, and transaction isolation in domain model persistence, some observed solutions to those problems, and the consequences of those solutions for application architecture. Drawing on the presenter's two decades of experience practicing DDD in multiple production systems, with different programming languages and various object persistence technologies, the talk will briefly survey the evolution of object persistence approaches, noting their performance, scalability, and isolation characteristics, culminating with exciting new possibilities offered by data grid technologies. However the bulk of the emphasis in the talk will be placed on patterns of domain model persistence with current Java ORM technologies.

Learn how to have as much fun with legacy code as you have on "greenfield" projects.
Everybody loves to start with a clean slate and build software from scratch. Unfortunately, such "greenfield" projects are hard to come by and most of us work with less glamorous "brownfield" software. A "brownfield" application can be a monolith you've inherited from others, a new project that needs to use existing legacy components or third party solutions. In this talk Anders Norås shares his real-world experiences on how to approach "brownfield" applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. You'll learn what patterns you can apply to shield yourself from legacy cruft, how to find good refactoring opportunities and when choosing suboptimal designs for parts of your solution can help the solution as a whole. Whether your maintaining an existing application, building new software atop of legacy components or simply cleaning up the mess others left behind, you're sure to pick up some tricks to combat the designs that otherwise would ruin your day.

Redis is a new kind of key-value database. It is a scalable high-performing distributed in-memory database that supports atomic and non-blocking operations. This presentation will give an introduction to this new open source project.
Redis is a key-value database that stands out from the crowd. It is not just another key-value database as it provides atomic and non-blocking operations on its keys and values. In Redis the values can be either primitives, sets or lists. Most other key-value databases allow only simple values like strings or bytes. There are commands to perform complex operations on these data structures, most in constant time. It is therefore not unreasonable to think of Redis as a data structures server. The dataset can be replicated using a master-slave setup and also be distributed across a set of servers using consistent hashing. The server provides blazing performance as most operations are non-blocking and the entire dataset is kept in-memory. Performance tests have shown results of 10000 SETs/second, 81000 GETs/second on an entry level Linux box. Redis is open source, and the database server and clients are being hosted on Google Code. The project is aiming for a final 1.0 release mid June 2009. In the presentation we'll take a look at the characteristics of the database server and the operations that it provides including demos of how it works in practice. The Java client will also be reviewed.

If all you need is a Bicycle, having a Space Shuttle instead isn't a good thing. Processing high volumes of data in batches using message oriented architecture and a relational database is something you should avoid (unless you are a real rocket scientist!). Instead you can try an easier approach using standard Java SE. This talk is about handling high volumes of data from legacy systems using Java.
You may think this is a stupid presentation. Who would ever get millions of transactions in files from a legacy system? Transactions will be placed from Web and properly load balanced as they get in. But the fact of the matter is, don't be so sure. There is a lot of legacy systems out there. In 1997 the Gartner Group estimated that there were 240 billion lines of Cobol code in active apps. Something like 90 percent of financial transactions are processed by Cobol code, and 75 percent of all business data processing is Cobol. Most of that code is still there after being fixed for 2000 bug. So why is all this Cobol stuff relevant to me? I develop using Java, not Cobol (Thank God!). It's relevant because Java is ready for the heavy lifting of replacing all this code. But since all systems can't be replaced in one go, you must interface with the existing solutions. Doing that using typical Java stack in the typical Java way, can give you an over-engineered and badly designed solution. The speaker spent the last 3,5 years as a software architect and developer replacing large mainframe applications using best practice Java architecture (Message oriented, Spring, Hibernate etc). Doing so he realized that new techniques have their place, but processing large batch files using Domain Driven Design and Hibernate probably wasn't the easiest way of dealing with legacy code and integration.
Morten currently works a senior consultant for Miles AS. His has been an active developer since the early 90s developing financial applications using Cobol/Mainframes, Client-Server technology, Microsoft .NET and Java.

Cucumber (http://cukes.info/) is a novel tool for Behaviour Driven Development. While most existing TDD/BDD tools are geared towards programmers, classes and objects, Cucumber nicely fills the communication gap between customers, programmers and testers.
Cucumber’s plain text language for describing an application’s behaviour has become a popular tool for many Ruby and Rails teams. With the recent Java support this great tool can be used on Java projects without a single line of Ruby. In this session you will see how Cucumber and BDD can be used on a real Java project. You will learn how to use Cucumber's simple and extensible domain-specific language that lets you marry functional requirements and automated functional tests into one. I will also show how to install and run Cucumber and give you some useful tips about how to get the most out of the tool and the process it is based on. The presentation will be in the form of a small, fast paced project, alternating between customer-team conversations and real-time programming with Cucumber and Java. This session will change how you approach requirements and testing of Java applications.ed project, alternating between customer-team conversations and real-time programming with Cucumber and Java.

Overviews the issues surrounding scaling agile techniques for distributed development teams, regulatory compliance, governance, large teams, complex environments, and leveraging legacy assets.
The majority of organizations have gotten their feet wet with Agile software development techniques and are now hoping to take it to the next stage. However, they’re discovering that the simple methodologies they initially adopted aren’t sophisticated enough to address the complex situations they find themselves in. This presentation overviews agile software development, shares data from recent industry surveys as to the adoption rate and success rate of agile techniques, and explores scaling issues such as distributed development teams, regulatory compliance, governance, large teams, complex environments, and leveraging legacy assets. Practices from the Rational Unified Process (RUP), Agile Modeling (AM), and Lean Development Governance which help to address scaling factors will be described in detail, as will tooling strategies. Once you go beyond the Agile rhetoric you will find that you can in fact scale it to meet the complexities of the real-world situations you find yourself in.

An introduction to the Ioke language.
Ioke is a new language, an experiment to see how expressive a language can be. It's a language for the JVM influenced by Io, Self, Smalltalk, Lisp and Ruby. It supports a prototype based object oriented system, is homoiconic, supports high level methods and macros and makes it easy to build DSLs and new abstractions from scratch. The presentation will first talk about the motivation for a new language, then talk about some of the more interesting features of Ioke, including the object system, the macro system and java integration features. It will also talk about how Ioke can be used in conjunction with other languages in a polyglot programming style.

Since applications were put on the web, developers have accepted loss of functionality and control of their product's user experience. We now have the tools to easily retake the web, and give users the functionality they crave.
h1. Problem scenario You are to replace a mainframe system, where the user interface consists of a black console with screens of green text, with a web application. Even though the screens are unintuitive, skilled users can navigate and manipulate the data efficiently. The expensive, high-tech, replacement web application has all kinds of nifty features to please the user visually. But a simple request, such as utilizing function keys and mouse-less navigation can be hard to cater for, because the IT department has standardized browsers on IE6. h1. The proposal Create your own thick client frontend which wraps a web browser widget. Such widgets are maturing and easy to customize. They render advanced pages, tackle JavaScript and Flash just as good as standard browsers. You now have a new layer where you can take control of the user experience where needed. The web page will behave as normally, but you can specifically tailor functionality for the whole application, or the context of a specific page. h1. if( FAIL ) ? If the frontend fails, it was hopefully a cheap investment to throw away. The web application can still be used with a normal browser.

In this talk I will show how a mashup of Confluence and the Enterprise Architect UML tool can be used as pragmatic and agile tools for creating good and maintainable architecture documentation.
h1. The problem Creating good architecture documentation is often a problem in many large projects and organizations. Common issues are: * Out of date documentation in various MS Office formats * Architecture documentation is spread around the filesystem and mailsystem making it difficult to find the most current version of the documentation * Cumbersome and costly (enterprise) architecture tools * Using tools that are not well suited for multi-user updates * Developers are unwilling to document * Non-standard modelling conventions * Duplicated and inconsistent information * The list goes on... h1. The solution A pragmatic and agile solution to most of these issues is to create a mashup of the Confluence wiki tool together with a UML tool like Sparx Enterprise Architect. A wiki such as Confluence is very well suited for agile "grassroots" knowledge management and documentation. It keeps documentation in a single place, makes it easy for a group of people to work on the documentation together, it has a good search function, and it has proven to be a tool that most developers like to use. A mashup integration of Confluence with the Enterprise Architect UML tool creates a powerful combination of two good tools. UML models are integrated in wiki pages, and the UML models will be updated automatically when the UML model is updated in the UML tool. Other topics covered in the presentation: * using the Java API of Enterprise Architect to publish UML diagrams to Confluence * creating a 4+1 view model of architecture in a wiki * using labels to ** organise the information and create views ** express relationships between various parts of the architecture model * how to version control wiki documentation in Confluence

Java reflection has some interesting abilities, not widely known, such as setting of final fields, discovering where in the call chain we are and the ability to make objects without calling a constructor. Based on topics from the Java Specialists Newsletter, it will make your ears ring and head explode.
In this presentation, we will look at some advanced uses of reflection to delegate method calls automatically, to determine where we are being called from and to create new enum values dynamically for unit test purposes, including modifying the switch statements on-the-fly. We will look at how we can use the stack information to determine the class type in a static context. We will demonstrate how Externalizable allows the private state of an object to be read and then modified. Lastly we will demonstrate how we can construct new objects without calling any of the available constructors. This talk will be aimed at the advanced Java specialist who does not shy away from reflection code. Topics from the Java Specialists Newsletter and related research.

By large the majority of us have been creating applications for the Web since the early 90's and we have "just" accepted the stateless nature of the Web and the fact that HTTP is limiting us to a request repsonse communication profile. With new emerging standards such as W3C's HTML 5 WebSockets we can change all of this!
By large the majority of us have been creating applications for the Web since the early 90's and we have "just" accepted the stateless nature of the Web and the fact that HTTP is limiting us to a request repsonse communication profile. Sixteen years later we have an opportunity to let Web communication take a gigantic step forward - if we let it - and forever change the way in which we build applications for the Web. Web applications have traditionally been seen as second tier citizens in our network infrastructure, not capable of fully participate in the backend message infrastructure due to its stateless architecture. One innovation - W3C's HTML 5 WebSockets - in particular will enable full-duplex communication, and finally bring an end to the tired request response paradigm traditionally associated with the Web, and allow browsers to become first class citizens in our network. With this new emerging standard and the potential it brings, it is now possible to simplify complex architectures and build statefull asynchronous systems and communicate with native protocols directly from the browser to any backend service. In this session, the speakers will offer their vision of the future of the Web, Web technologies, address the importance of browser support of the W3C WebSocket and Server-Sent Events standards, and offer insight into the key role developers' play in W3C standards proliferation and the impact they might have on the end users. During the session real-life demos and examples of the use of WebSockets and other communication standards such as Server-Sent Events and Cross-document messaging will be shown. The techniques and technologies covered in this session will include, but are not limited to, JavaScript, Flash, Silverlight, and communication protocols such as AMQP, XMPP, and Stomp.

The session will compare a number of Http clients and see how HTTPCache4j supersedes them all.
Have you ever tried to write a HTTP or RESTful client using the libraries out there? Using java.net.URLConnection or Commons HttpClient? How do you cache your results? Do you use a proxy? Is server side caching enough? NO! Enter HTTPCache4j. You may use the library as a standard HTTP client, using just the resolver modules. Or you may use it as a full blown HTTP cache on the client. Your choice.

An overview of alternative concurrency paradigms for the JVM (Actors, STM and Dataflow).
Writing concurrent programs in Java is hard and writing correct concurrent programs is even harder. What should be noted is that the main problem is not concurrency itself but the use of mutable shared state. Reasoning about concurrent updates to, and guarding of, mutable shared state is extremely difficult. It imposes problems like dealing with race conditions, deadlocks, live locks, thread starvation etc. It might come as a surprise to some people but there are alternatives to the so-called 'Shared-State Concurrency' (that has been adopted by C, C++, Java and become the default industry standard way of dealing with concurrency problems). In this talk we will discuss the importance of immutability and explore alternative paradigms such as Dataflow Concurrency, Message-Passing Concurrency and Software Transactional Memory (STM). We will have a pragmatic discussion on the drawbacks and benefits with each paradigm and through hands-on examples show you how each one, in its own way, can raise the abstraction level and give you a model that is much easier to reason about and use. We will show you how, by choosing the right abstractions and technologies, you can make hard concurrency problems close to trivial. All discussions are driven by examples using state-of-the-art implementations available for the JVM.

Although object-orientation has been the mainstream programming language paradigm a long time, and domain driven design has been one of the hot topics in application development for some time, many real world projects end up with an anemic domain model. This manifests a problem because we are unable to leverage language features to achieve an easily maintainable application.
Object-orientation has been the mainstream programming language paradigm for the last 20 years. One of the central techniques in object-oriented programming is encapsulation using objects that both contain data and behavior. Nevertheless, in real applications we tend to end up with anemic domain models as opposed to "proper" domain models, where we have objects that only have data and no behavior, or vice versa. In many cases this results in a procedural style of programming, rather than an object-oriented style, not leveraging the language's features. Encapsulation suffers, possibly resulting in tight coupling in the application. In this talk I will try to give some reason why this happens, which problems this causes, and possible ways to avoid it.

You've probably heard of JRuby. You may even have tried it. But a lot has changed in the past year, and JRuby is better than ever before!
This talk will demonstrate how JRuby has truly become a first-class JVM language. JRuby can integrate with all those pesky Java libraries that needed Java classes. JRuby's performance is substantially better than it was a year ago. JRuby has started to utilize the new invokedynamic bytecode for fast dynamic calls. JRuby supports libraries like Hibernate, JAX-RS, and JUnit4. JRuby can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with any language on the JVM and integrate just as well. At the same time, JRuby brings innovative Ruby libraries to the JVM like Rake, RSpec and Cucumber. Come hear the latest news about JRuby, from Java integration to performance to Ruby and Rails updates. We'll demonstrate several key Java libraries working with plain old Ruby code. And we'll show you why JRuby should be your dynamic language of choice for building applications on the JVM.

Value objects are as overlooked as they are valuable. They express fine-grained, informational concepts in the problem domain and are associated with a number of practices in the technical domain. This session looks at a number of concepts and patterns, focusing primarily on Java but also mentioning value implementations in other languages.
Objects do not live in a free society: they exist for a purpose; they are not created with equal rights; they should not aspire to equality. What this means in practice is that objects live in a class-ridden society where each class serves a different role in the program as a whole. One category of object in need of attention and liberation is for representing domain values. Values are fine-grained and informational. They are inherent in the problem domain, but are often flattened into little more than plain integers and strings in the implementation, weakening the correspondence of the code to the situation it addresses. When it comes to identifying and implementing the Value Object pattern, there is a great deal more to be taken into consideration than can reasonably fitted into a single pattern. This talk looks at the practices and concepts that surround values both in Java and in other languages.

JSR-330+Guice leverages recently added language features to enable the best of both words: abstraction without the boilerplate!
Before Guice, the Java programming language subjected developers to a false dichotomy: 1. Use "new" to write concise but tightly coupled code. If you need more abstraction later, you'll have to update all of the N callers. or 2. Write a factory, so you can easily change the implementation later. You might end up doing unnecessary work, not to mention make your code harder to read. Guice leverages recently added language features to enable the best of both words: abstraction without the boilerplate! JSR-330's @Inject is the new new. Start off with coupled and straightforward code, and if you need more flexibility down the road, you can change your code in one place without having to update N callers. This speakers will compare factories and service locators with dependency injection, with and without Guice. Then he'll show you how to use Guice to make your code more modular, readable, and testable than ever before. All you need is a working knowledge of the language.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the friendliest format for cross server sharing of data. This live coding session starts with an empty HTML page, and ends up with a searchable flickr integration using JSON. Time permitting, we will mash it up with Twitter.
XML used to be the format of choice for transferring data or content from one system to another. JSON has more or less replaced XML for this task. Among the reasons is the low amount of overhead surrounding the actual data. Another thing is JSONs readiness when it enters your program: It is a programatic object, immediately after transfer, ready to reveal its data. This session will demonstrate how little code is actually necessary to do "near" real life integration between two sites using JavaScript and JSON. It could be done as a 10 minute lightning talk with focus on the client side technologies only. As a 60 minute talk the intro could be longer, and more examples and integrations with other sites like twitter could be shown. Also server side handling of JSON could be demonstrated.

Learn about the pros and cons of Groovy and while an statically typed yet expressive language such as Scala is an interesting alternative.
There is a good reason why dynamic languages such as Groovy and Ruby are getting a lot of attention. They are powerful, expressive languages that enable developers to easily write concise programs. However, not all of their benefits derive from being dynamic. Many important benefits are simply due to modern language design such as the support for closures. Moreover, dynamic languages have some inherent drawbacks. The extremely limited compile-time checking requires developers to write significantly more tests and severely limits how much help an IDE can provide to a developer.

There are many ways to schedule a job to run at a later time in an enterprise Java application. Learn about some of them, and why it's trickier than it sounds.
Enterprise applications often need to schedule tasks to run at a later time, either once or periodically. There's several ways to go about this: EJB 2.1 introduced a timer service (which will get some sorely needed extensions in JEE 6), there's the popular Quartz system from OpenSymphony, and Oracle and IBM promote the Timer and Work Manager API (CommonJ, JSR-236), to mention a few. And then there's always cron. This lightning talk explains why you might need a job scheduler, compares common solutions and frameworks, and describes some gotchas you should avoid.

Put your build system on a solid state drive, and reduce the development round trip with 50%.
Solid state drives have recently become easily available. Their performence may provide a way of reducing the time spent on on the development cycle: compiling, packeting and deploying applications. This paper shows promising results by locating the code base and local maven repository on a solid state drive. Initial experiments shows that time spent on waiting for your code to compile may be reduced by 50%.

By combining the power of compiled and interpreted languages in the same application, can we get the best of both worlds? This presentation gives an introduction to the Java scripting engine API (JSR 223) and how it can be used in combination with various scripting langauges in real-world applications.
By combining the power of compiled and interpreted languages in the same application, can we get the best of both worlds? Can embedding scripting capabilities in our applications help us develop software that is more flexible and more usable? Can we reduce development time by making volatile and highly fluctuating application logic customizable, dynamic and scriptable? Can we make life easier for ourselves as developers by choosing the right language for the right task at any given time? This presentation gives an introduction to the concept of scripting engines and how they can be used to add scripting capabilities to real-world applications. We take a closer look at the Java scripting engine API (JSR 223) and popular implementations of the standard. The session includes practical examples and actual code.

We know how to create maintainable, flexible and solid Java code using Test Driven Development. With growing client side complexity, we need to write JavaScript in the same professional way. This hands-on demonstration will provide you with all the necessary pieces to do true Test Driven Development in JavaScript.
We create maintainable, flexible and solid Java code with the use of techniques such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. When it comes to client side Web development with JavaScript, the story is quite different. JavaScript has for a long time been perceived as a toy programming language for making flashy buttons and simple form validation. But now as the client side grows larger and more complex, we should take the lessons learned from TDD in Java and apply them to our JavaScript development. There are many myths surrounding TDD and JavaScript, and we will in this session bust some of these: * There are no proper frameworks for test driven JavaScript development. * There is no IDE support. * It isn't possible to integrate it with my build or CI system. Our hands-on demonstration will show you a JavaScript application capable of controlling TANDBERG video systems and provide you with all the necessary pieces to do true Test Driven Development in JavaScript yourself. This includes: * Our minimal test framework for JavaScript testing * Running tests from Eclipse with the push of a button * Using mocks and stubs to test code in isolation * Testing of JavaScript integrated with your build and continuous integration systems

This presentation will provide a retrospective of the trade-offs compared to C++ illustrated by Java, C# and other VM-based programming languages with Garbage-Collection, why scripting languages simultaneously thrived, and what this teaches us about the applicability of technology to emerging challenges and environments.
Java’s appearance at the dawn of the Internet Age helped to propel it to near-instant prominence, and lodged cross-platform virtual machines and garbage-collection firmly into our mainstream consciousness. In Java’s wake, .NET introduced the concept of the “cross-language” virtual machine, and helped to foster a new discussion on the benefits of functional programming. Did Java and C# have an evolutionary advantage over C++, or were they simply “Cool” (the original code name for C# / .NET)? In retrospect, what were the actual efficiency advantages provided by each language? And despite the grip that these languages exerted on “enterprise” applications, how did scripting languages such as PHP, Python and Perl manage to thrive and multiply? Looking forward, what do these lessons teach us about the applicability of technology to emerging challenges and environments such as Cloud Computing, and what languages are rising to the top as a result?

Domain driven design, the importance of good API's in a service oriented architecture.
StatoilHydro has practiciezed Domain Driven Design since 2004, and over these years we have experienced that some things are more difficult than others, some things more demanding than others and some things more valuable than others. There are two things that stands out in this context, the value of the ubiquitous language, and the hardship of API design. The importance of good API design are not though in school, and not much is written. On the other hand, good API's is the foundation of good software, and with SOA it become even more important. In this talk we will share our experience from designing and integrating some of our largest software systems where Domain Driven Design has been successfully applied. Examples of successful and not so successful APIs will be provided.

* The most powerful way to prevent bugs in code delivered to testing, is to both detect them earlier and prevent them being injected * Software Inspections are proven capable of doing these things effectively, but the traditional costs are inhibiting * Agile Specification QC solves this problem by focussing on defect measurement by sampling, and strict numeric process exit.
Traditional Software Inspection is often uneconomic and ties up valuable staff resources. Shifting the emphasis from cleanup (that is, from identifying defects and then removing them), to merely sampling the defect level of specifications, produces significant benefits. It enables the quality level of specifications to be determined more rapidly. Consequently, the QC can be carried out more frequently. Systems and software engineers rapidly learn, through SQC feedback, to take standards seriously, which in turn reduces defect injection. Further, by analyzing where/how the defects occur continuous process improvement can be supported.
"Tom Gilb is a freelance consultant, teacher and author serving clients mainly in Europe and the US. He has 3 books in print: “Competitive Engineering” (2005, one chapter on SQC), “Principles of Software Engineering Management” (chapters on Inspection, 1988 !, 20th printing) and “Software Inspection” (1993, Japanese translation). Tom Gilb specializes in software engineering, systems engineering, and technical management. He resides in Oslo and London. His most recent papers, book manuscripts, and slides are available on www.gilb.com Tom was an early professional colleague, supporter, and inspection-pupil (1974-5) of Michael Fagan (Tom wrote over 80 pages about Inspection in his 1976 Software metrics book), and a consultant to Ron Radice (1980, inventor of CMM and co-inventor with Fagan of Inspection, author of "High Quality Low Cost Software Inspections"), and Tom was the first to preach and teach inspections outside of IBM, in Norway and many other countries. He developed his own version of Software Inspection (about 400 process changes compared to Fagan's version) and documented this (with co-author Dorothy Graham) in the worlds first published book on Inspection (Software Inspection 1993, now in 14th printing). The book also includes 2 chapters on the Defect Prevention Process (aka CMMI Level 5) and many guest chapter case studies. By 2003 he had developed and practiced an Agile version Inspection, renaming it Agile Specification Quality Control (SQC). In September 2008 he and Kai were invited by JUSE (Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers) to Keynote their annual software conference on Inspections, and to present a one day tutorial on the subject. They also were invited to work with Hitachi Software, and Sony Corporation. Sony is currently spreading the Agile SQC within Sony and to many other Japanese Corporations. In 1989-90 Tom successfully spread the method to aircraft engineering design at Douglas and Boeing, with large scale adoption and detailed study and proof of effectiveness. From 1988 Tom and Kai spread his Inspection method to Hewlett Packard HP Corporate and worldwide, with well-documented savings in books and papers by HP (Robert Grady).
Kai works in partnership with Tom, teaching, running workshops, consulting, starting up projects, saving projects, solving problems, lecturing, writing books and articles, course & lecture materials etc. Kai has been teaching and helping clients practice Inspections and Agile Inspections since about 1990, at major organizations like Ericsson, Nokia HP, and Citigroup (2003) - where he co-invented, with Tom, the current formal process "Agile Inspections", with Tom. Our initial client proved on many projects, a reduction of bugs 8 to 1 in 6 months. He most recently co-taught in Japan at JUSE, Sony and Hitachi, and for a few other corporations such as IBM.

This talk explains the top ten tips seen through the eyes of companies doing a SOA implementation the hard way. Learn the best tips for a SOA rollout and see real world examples for where these tips work and what happens when they aren't adhered to.
You have been handed the keys and a blank slate to build a new services-based architecture. Are you up for the task? Do you have the knowledge, judgment, and combination of hard and soft skills needed to plan, design, and execute a significant SOA project? Implementing a strong and flexible SOA can be a difficult challenge for an experienced architect, let alone someone with less experience. Many complex architecture projects end in failure, or are scaled back so that something can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time. In this session Jeff explores the key characteristics of successful SOA projects. He covers some of the patterns, and anti-patterns, tool sets, and strategies that he himself learned the hard way – through his own trial and error experiences as an architect. Last, he provides a strategy and blueprint for achieving a high likelihood of success in your SOA project. Key session topics include: * How to apply SOA patterns to different classes of problems; * The common failures of a SOA project and how to prevent them; * Architectural strategies that offer the best chance of achieving project success; * And more.

Any scalable web application uses object caching, both to reduce database load and to improve response time. But choosing the right cache management product is critical for performance. We have benchmarked several cache setups and give our results here.
“You have twenty server instances running. Available bandwidth is measured in gigabits, and your application’s user interface has been carefully designed to satisfy the high customer expectations. But there is one ugly flaw in this pretty picture: How can the monolithic, centralized database handle the load?” In practice, any scalable web application uses object caching, both to reduce database load and to improve response time. But creating efficient mechanisms for cache management is hard, especially in distributed environments such as clusters or clouds. Important challenges are data freshness, data consistency and fault tolerance. Several products promise to reduce the burden by providing automatic object cache management among distributed servers. Notable examples are Ehcache, memcached and Oracle Coherence. At BEKK, we have studied several such products. Our results indicate that finding the right solution with a proper setup is critical for performance. This talk presents an overview of our experience, including benchmarks.

This presentation will outline how Escenic went from an RPC based approach to a RESTful webservice. The presentation will cover the design of both the web service and the client. We will list lessons learned through the project and how these lessons have affected the end result.
This presentation will outline how Escenic went from an RPC based approach to a RESTful webservice. The presentation will cover the design of both the web service and the client. We will list lessons learned through the project and how these lessons have affected the end result. You will not NOT learn anything about the jungle of RESTful frameworks, as they are only tools to get the job done. You will learn the principles of REST and how it affects client side programmers. The focus will be on how to build the server and client correctly according to the principles behind REST, and not misuse the term as Flickr, SocialSite and Amazon do. RESTful HTTP is more than just using HTTP: it is identifying resources using URIs, exposing relationships between resources, and manipulating resources using the semantics of HTTP verbs. It also means designing resources to fit the constraints, based on nouns (and sometimes verbs) of the domain

That's a stupid question, isn't it? Memory is just where you keep things. Nevertheless the majority of of performance problems I have seen were in the end connected to memory issues. In modern computers memory is a complex multi-layered thing affected by the hardware, operating system and the JVM. And considering that it's shared among multiple CPUs we get a lot of classical distributed problems without an actual network anywhere in sight.
You should attend this talk if any of the following questions give you pause: - How slow is memory? - How pagefaults happen and what do they mean? - Why swapfile and Java don't get along? - What does "synchronized" do besides locking? - What does volatile really do? - What do you need CompareAndSwap for? - Why GC doesn't scale well and what is being done about it? - What hardware developments can change the JVM game? To answer those questions I'll build a simple CPU model in Java to illustrate the concepts in a comprehensible way.

Mobile and Cloud Computing are two emerging technologies that on their own are increasingly important. Together they pose a powerful and elegant solution to many existing and likely business cases. This talk introduces the audience to some of the more likely scenarios where mobile and Cloud Computing will be seen working together and augmenting each others strengths.
h1. How the Cloud is and will be an invisible presence in many mobile applications. As two technologies that are increasing rapidly in importance and spread both PaaS/SaaS and mobile devices (“phones”) are highly important technologies on their own. Closer to 750 million people are now using cellphones world wide. And PaaS is in the beginning of every hype curve. Together these two technologies pose an emerging opportunity and solution to many existing and likely business cases. The needs that drive these business cases are on one hand the need for a mobile application with an optimal usage of the mobile device when it comes to screen size, GUI lock and feel, processing and bandwidth. And on the other side the need for at least one or more of the following: * High processing capabilities, high volumes of data and high bandwidth. * Collaboration, Data sharing, Multitasking and Scheduling The type off distributed application that emerges from these needs and wants are applications where the client is a cellphone with a thin or semi-thick client software with a backend running on a PaaS solution. The high and growing number of cellphones with increasing capabilities means that the potential market is far larger than for a personal computer software solution. There are a number of reasons why the PaaS approach is preferable and possibly the only solution compared to a thick client software solution on the cellphone. These can be the limited storage space, processing power and bandwidth. Also the need realtime and data with a short shelf life dictates a solution where the data is aggregated and stored centrally. Sharing data and collaboration are others. The client ideally uses the native lock and feel of the client platform. The bandwidth needed between the cellphone client and PaaS side should be optimized by using lean protocols and possible compression of data. The PasS side should be able to scale dynamically based on changing client numbers.
Developer and architect with an interest in the opportunities and challenges given by PaaS and Mobile clients. This interest being sparked by work on an iphone app with a Google App engine backend.

This session will look at a number of security concerns and how the ESAPI library provides a unified solution for security. This includes authorization, authentication of services, encoding, encrypting, and validation. This session will discuss a number of issues that can be solved through standardizing on the open source Enterprise Security API.
When it comes to cross cutting software concerns, we expect to have or build a common framework or utility to solve this problem. This concept is represented well in the Java world with the log4j framework, which abstracts the concern of logging, where it logs and the management of logging. The one cross cutting software concern that seems for most applications to be piecemeal is that of security. Security concerns include certification generation, SSL, protection from SQL Injection, protection from XSS, user authorization and authentication. Each of these separate concerns tend to have there own standards and libraries and leaves it as an exercise for the development team to cobble together a solution which includes multiple needs.... until now... Enterprise Security API toolkit from OWASP. This session will look at a number of security concerns and how the ESAPI library provides a unified solution for security.

If you live on JVM and want to understand the principals of actors, agents, fork/join, map/reduce, STM and others to write safe concurrent code in Java, Groovy, Scala or Clojure, this session is for you.
Does your processor laugh at your code? Does it dawdle, travel over other processes, does it feel bored all the time, instead of taking full engagement and focus properly on the work at hands? It's your old-styled code that's failing here, code, which has been written for the processor's single-core grandpa. We all live in a new era now, single-thread has been out of fashion for a while and certainly doesn't appeal to the young processors. I'd like to show you how to write in modern fresh multi-threaded style, so popular with these processor youngsters, a style, which doesn't let them sleep. Write about brave Actors, lay Fork/Join, mention Parallel Arrays, call in Agents and ensure smooth Dataflow. The processors will adore you for that and will work tirelessly to read your code start to end as fast as possible while making your applications lightning-fast again. If you want to harness all the of the cores in modern multicore processors, this session is for you.

Come see a more intelligent way to build Java based projects using a build DSL and convention or configuration… This session will cover intro to advance features showing off how easy it is to get started and how power the tool is if you need it… come… Enter the Gradle
In the Java build space, first there was ANT, which provided a reliable way to build without an IDE. Then there was Maven, which provided standardization in build life cycles and dependency management. Now... Enter the Gradle, which provides convention over configuration approach to the build process and an approach at building that isn't based XML. This session assumes no familiarly with Gradle as it introduces this new approach at building projects. It is very helpful to be able to read and understand groovy to get the most from the session. This session will look at multi-language or polyglot projects, as well as integration to ANT and Maven. It will conclude with building custom plugins for the Gradle build process.

Embrace change! While Agile is something everyone is talking about, many struggle with handling change. I'll walk you through some common pitfalls so you can avoid them.
At the core of Agile lies the ability to adapt and change as you learn more about the system and problem domain. And even though many are doing the ceremonies of Agile, they often fail to acknowledge what it really means to be ready for change. In several projects I have seen things that is constantly blocking our efforts to become agile. Doing the ceremony might make you feel good, but it doesn't mean you are reaping the full benefits of Agile. In this lightning talk I will take you through some of the common mistakes I have seen, and hopefully prevent you from doing them too.

TRONbot is a robot, the software written in Scala, and its brains is based on a neural network implementation, why Scala, and was it the right choice ?
TRONbot is a wheeled robot with a simple neural network implementation at its core. Neural networks are electrical simulations of the neurons that exists in our own brains, either in hardware or in software, and are mostly used for signal interpretation or as in this case simulated behavior and AI. The talk will focus on the experiences made using Scala for controlling a robot, and how neural networks can solve relatively hard problems you face making an autonomous robot. I will go into brief detail about the low-level aspects of the implementation, but the corpus of the talk will be on how I implemented a neural network in Scala for autonomous behavior of the robot. I will also mention other applications of neural networks and how to get started building your very own robot.

The Java Virtual Machine has become the most frequent target for the implementation of new programming languages. Both scripting and compiled languages find a home in the JVM that gives them unprecedented portability. These languages can be used in the development of enterprise applications by augmenting or leveraging the Java platform’s functionality, or by eliminating the need of using the Java language altogether. Learn how to go about building third-party language functionality from Python, Ruby, or others into your enterprise Java applications, what to look for, what to avoid, and when and why it’s a good idea.

Your brain is your most powerful asset - have you thought about how to put yourself in a position to maximize yours? This talk is a fast paced look at what modern research has to teach us about our very personal computer.
The single most important tool in any developers toolbox isn't a fancy IDE or some spiffy new language - it's our brain. Despite ever faster processors with multiple cores and expanding amounts of RAM, we haven't yet created a computer to rival the ultra lightweight one we carry around in our skulls - in this session we'll learn how to make the most of it. We'll talk about why multitasking is a myth, the difference between the left and the right side of your brain, the importance of flow and why exercise is good for more than just your waist line.

How we get more mileage out of our test hardware by letting system tests specify what they need to run.
In embedded systems testing, hardware and time are the scarcest resources. At TANDBERG, we have more software configurations we wish to test than we have hardware for. To make matters worse, some of the test configurations requires specific hardware options. To solve this, we've developed an extension to TestNG where each test specifies what resources it requires to run. In this session we describe how we've implemented a resource pool which allocates test resources as specified by the tests. Each test can specify a number of systems based on properties like system type, hardware options or software version, and those systems will not be allocated to any other for as long as the test is running. Before the systems are entered into the pool they can be automatically configured, and they are reset between between test runs to ensure that the ordering of tests doesn't influence the result. The resource pool itself are written to be as general as possible, so that it should be easy to change storage backends or even to use it for projects outside of TANDBERG's development department.

This is an experience report of how an adventure came to a grinding halt. The talk will tell our story and share some of the things we learned from our failure. Usually you get to hear about the successes and the amazing stories of how people in a garage with a single light bulb and a baud modem ended up with a google amount of cash. This story is different, but it might just be all the more insightful as it will show you how you can go wrong.
For every successful start-up, there are a bunch of others who did not make it. This is an experience report from one of those companies which did not make it. We set out to become the number one social music experience on the planet. Usually you only hear the amazing stories about how magic happened and a success was created. You seldom get a chance to hear how you can accomplish failure and maybe you learn enough that you end up holding a similar talk.

So now you have your builds and tests done on a CI server. What's next? This talk discusses problems & techniques to expand automation to handle processes that have been done manually, like integrating components.
In this talk, we'll discuss the techniques that go beyond simple build and test, by using Hudson, an open-source CI server. These techniques allow developers to get more out of their investment to CI. This talk targets those who have started using CI and are used to the idea of automated build. * One of the key themes of a larger automation is to control the flow of changes. This may be between developers in the same team or between different teams. This talk discusses these topics and techniques in details. * As CI produces and consumes a lot of binaries that are only slightly different, tracking them accurately is important. This talk discusses techniques and challenges. * Techniques to reduce the turn-around time of a long build/test.

Performance tuning isn't difficult - and we'll prove it, by tuning a real world application in realtime.
That performance tuning is still considered to be a dark art is attributable to the lack of understanding of performance tuning best practices. In this talk Dan, our typical developer, will go bumbling off in an attempt to tune a poorly performing application. During the process we will introduce a number of best practices that could have helped him reach his performance goals, without the need of magic.

JRuby and Rails, JRuby's newer Java integration features, JRuby as a good JVM and Java platform citizen.
JRuby has come a long way from being a simple Ruby implementation. Recent releases have steadily added more and better Java integration features, ranging from "real" Java class generation all the way to better support for annotations and Java's reflective APIs. JRuby adds Ant support to the populate and beautiful Rake build tool. JRuby provides integration of Maven and RubyGems. JRuby deploys to normal Java application servers and works great with standard Java APIs like Hibernate. JRuby is becoming a first-class JVM language. In this talk we'll explore a little bit about why JRuby and Rails are easy and fun ways to build applications. Then we'll dive into the real subject: how you can get JRuby and Rails integrated into your organization. Whether you build web applications or desktop apps, whether you use nosql database or JPA, whether you want a more expressive language or a richer ecosystem, JRuby has something to offer.

This talk will introduce the Erlang programming language, describing how to do more with less. We will be giving examples on the syntax and constructs which allow Erlang programs to generally be 4 – 10 times shorter than their counterparts in Java, C and C++ while achieving 99,999% availability. We will provide examples not only of the Ericsson success stories, but also from banking, finance, distributed databases, instant messaging and web2.0, describing how Erlang has found its role in these market segments.
Can anything at all be modeled without objects? Think concurrent! Hans Nilsson will tell you how with the programming language Erlang and its middleware OTP. He will describe why Erlang, originally invented to handle the next generation of Telecom products, has become successful in a much wider range of sectors including enbedded devices, messaging systems, banking and e-commerce. Discover why Erlang systems have proved achieving 99,999% availability with a fraction of the efforts compared to conventional technologies. In contrast to systems written in Java, C or C++, thanks to its no shared memory approach, Erlang programs usually do not need any porting effort to scale well on multicore architectures. The presentation will conclude by introducing the growing Erlang community, the open source success stories such as CouchDB, Riak, RabbitMQ and Disco, and describe what companies such as Amazon, E*Trade, Facebook and Yahoo! are doing with Erlang.
Hans Nilsson is the technical lead in Erlang Solutions' Stockholm office. He joined the Ericsson Computer Science Lab in 1988, the year after Joe Armstrong, the father of Erlang.

Hans then went on to study the budding Voice over IP field and implemented his first Erlang-based SIP stack in 1998, eventually becoming Ericsson's representative in the GSM Association SIP Technical Expert Group. Before joining Erlang Solutions, he worked in a tiger team doing advanced prototyping with Erlang in close cooperation with the Intel Performance Lab.

A characterization test is a means to describe (characterize) the actual behaviour of an existing piece of software, and therefore protect existing behaviour of legacy code against unintended changes via automated testing. In this talk you will learn how you can generate characterization tests automatically for existing code bases.
A characterization test is a means to describe (characterize) the actual behaviour of an existing piece of software, and therefore protect existing behaviour of legacy code against unintended changes via automated testing. In this talk I will share my experience from a project where we generated fast running characterization automatically from existing slow-running integration/end-to-end tests. The characterization tests helped us do a major redesign of a core calculation module in an insurance system without breaking existing functionality. The talk will cover both the concept of characterization tests, as well as demonstrate an open source (.NET) framework for generating characterization tests for your application.

Groovy lends extra strengths to the Java programming language, and is recognized as a developer tool for solving practical problems. This tool can easily be applied to maven plugins, and proves to make them less error prone, easier to read and easier to test.
Groovy lends extra strengths to the Java programming language. These strenghts can be actively used to enhance Maven plugins. These plugins may often be quick and dirty, written by developers to solve some very specific problem. If they get adopted by projects, it should be compulsory to ensure their quality by code review and 100% test coverage. Many of the dirty fragments of code can be rewritten with Groovy to become both easier to read and maintan, and easier to cover with unit tests. This presentation sums up the experiences of having groovy-ised 3 (proprietary) enterprise Maven plugins: cxjboss, cxbuildnumber and mtregelverk.

An experience report using Scala Actors in a event based system for video conferencing. During the presentation you will see why, where and how we use Scala Actors. Exemplified with design patterns from the code.
Telecom services are in general based on event driven archictectures. With the introduction of Scala and Actors on the JVM platform, everyone developing concurrent systems has a new tool. The Actor model where introduced in 1973 and made famous by Erlang and Ericssons Telecom systems, and now finally available on the JVM. The presentation is an experience report based on implementation of a conference solution for video conferencing. The project started out in april 2008, switched to Scala and Actors in December 2009 and launched in june 2010. During the talk the main drivers for the architecture, how Scala and Actors are used and our experiences so far will be presented.

This session shows how to identify and leverage design elements that already exist in your code.
This session describes the current thinking about emergent design, discovering design in code. The hazard of Big Design Up Front in software is that you don't yet know what you don't know, and design decisions made too early are just speculations without facts. Emergent design techniques allow you to wait until the last responsible moment to make design decisions. This talk covers four areas: emergent design enablers, battling things that make emergent design hard, finding idiomatic patterns, and how to leverage the patterns you find. It includes both proactive (test-driven development) and reactive (refactoring, metrics, visualizations, tests) approaches to discovering design, and discusses the use of custom attributes, DSLs, and other techniques for utilizing them. The goal of this talk is to provide nomenclature, strategies, and techniques for allowing design to emerge from projects as they proceed, keeping your code in sync with the problem domain.

Hadoop is the divide-and-conquer MapReduce framework from Apache based on concepts from Google, and currently used to solve terabyte data computations at Yahoo, Facebook and even the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
Moore's law has finally hit the wall and CPU speeds have actually decreased in the last few years. The industry is reacting with hardware with an ever-growing number of cores and software that can leverage "grids" of distributed, often commodity, computing resources. But how is a traditional Java developer supposed to easily take advantage of this revolution? The answer is the Apache Hadoop family of projects. Hadoop is a suite of Open Source APIs at the forefront of this grid computing revolution and is considered the absolute gold standard for the divide-and-conquer model of distributed problem crunching. The well-travelled Apache Hadoop framework is curently being leveraged in production by prominent names such as Yahoo, IBM, Amazon, Adobe, AOL, Facebook and Hulu just to name a few. In this session, you'll start by learning the vocabulary unique to the distributed computing space. Next, we'll discover how to shape a problem and processing to fit the Hadoop MapReduce framework. We'll then examine the incredible auto-replicating, redundant and self-healing HDFS filesystem. Finally, we'll fire up several Hadoop nodes and watch our calculation process get devoured live by our Hadoop cluster. At this talk's conclusion, you'll understand the suite of Hadoop tools and where each one fits in the aim of conquering large data sets.

Test-Driven Development is common nowadays at the unit level. We find it helps at system-scale too. Starting from high-level tests helps us focus on what to deliver and to produce with better structural designs. Early integration also helps to flush out project issues at the start--when we have time to do something about it.
We present our experience applying "system-test first" test-driven development (TDD) in the development of large systems and systems-of-systems. We try to address integration and system testing as early as possible. The sooner the system is in a deployable state, the easier it is to react to changing business needs because we can deliver new features to users as soon as is deemed necessary. We therefore start by writing tests that build and deploy the system and interact with it from the outside and, to make those tests pass, add code to the system in the classic "unit-test first" TDD style. Many teams applying TDD start writing unit-tests and leave integration and system testing until late in the project because they find it difficult to write tests that cope with the distributed architecture and concurrent behaviour of their system. We will describe how we address common pitfalls, including unreliable tests, tests that give false positives, slow-running tests and test code that becomes difficult to maintain as the system grows. We will also describe how writing system tests guides our architectural decisions. Writing unit tests first guides design of the code to be flexibile and maintainable. In a similar way, we have found that writing system tests first guides the architecture to be easier to monitor, manage and support.

The switch to multicore servers will soon cause most "call-stack" type systems to run into severe performance trouble. To avoid this dilemma we need to find another architectural metaphor without that weakness. Right now Event Driven Architectures seem like the most promising idea around.
You thought you would get away from your performace problems at the next data center upgrade. The upgrade arrived, and they announced proudly that performance is now 35 % better. But, when you measure, the system is actually running slower - each request response time has become longer. This nightmare scenario is a realistic risk for most multi-user systems as they are written and deployed today. What has happened is that the shift from "faster processors" to "more cores" changes the characteristics of performance (latency and response time vs capacity and throughput). What we risk is that our software architecture will not be able to take advantage of hardware upgrades. Thus the shift to multicore will push us out of the "call stack comfort zone" and force us to rethink how we model and architect our systems. When looking for a new mind-set that will help us out from this performance and scalability nightmare, Event Driven Architectures seems like one of the best ideas around.

Are you constantly finding yourself running your app in the debugger, joggling breakpoints and drilling your way through datastructures, just to figure out what the heck is going on, despite you have the full sourcecode? Work smarter, not harder - and throw your debugger away today!
Many programmers rely heavily on source-level debuggers, so much that whenever they come across a problem or some soucecode they don't understand, their first course of action is to fire up the debugger and single-step through it with their eyes glued to the list of breakpoints and watched variables. There are good reasons to break this habit, and in the process you will gain a deeper understanding of the application, enabling you to fix more bugs, improve the quality of the code, and simply become a better programmer.

This talk presents several performance anti-patterns along with a static analysis tool to discover them. The identified anti-patterns relate to inefficient call and data flows in the context of web-programming, communication, and data manipulation. To automatically discover these issues, we use a semantic code query system (Yonita).
People often blame the programming language for the performance or scalability issues of a certain piece of software. However, the significant number of this kind of issues has the source in the code of an application, and not the language used to implement it. This talk presents several performance anti-patterns along with a static analysis tool to discover them. The identified anti-patterns relate to inefficient call and data flows in the context of web-programming, communication, and data manipulation. To automatically discover these issues, we use Yonita, a semantic code query system focused on capturing the behavior of a program.

On October 1st Maven 3.0 will be released. Many infrastructure level technologies and tools have been created to enable the release of Maven 3.0 and this talk will give an overview of what these technologies are how they will take shape in the future. Sisu is the IoC system Sonatype has built on top of Guice, and is the base platform upon which all our tools are now built, including Maven 3.0. Aether is the new Repository API that has been generalized and decoupled from Maven which can be used as a stand-alone library to give any Java application some Maven repository-fu. Maven Shell what we see becoming the de facto way to use Maven 3.0. A long lived process with Maven super powers. Polyglot Maven is evolving into a family of DSLs to provide novel ways to use the Maven 3.0 core. Proviso is the production runtime provisioning system Sonatype is using internally for continuous delivery and is based on the powerful Eclipse p2 provisioning platform. Benson is Sonatype's Maven-focused distribution of Hudson taking into account everything that we've learned about Maven 3.0 during its development and how Maven should operate optimally within a CI environment: there will be no better way to work with Maven and Hudson.

Learn pattern matching in Scala!
Are you sick of the huge amounts of if-statements, instanceof-checks and type-casts it can take to destructure and match on a datastructure in Java. Does it annoy you that you can't switch on whatever you want or that you can't catch two kinds of exceptions in one catch block ? Then this talk is for you. Scala is here and packs a huge amount of cool features, many unknown to Java developers. One of those features is 'Pattern matching'. This talk will guide you through Pattern matching and explain what it is, how it works and how you can use it to write incredibly declarative code.

HTML5 WebSocket is a standard with the potential to bring unprecedented change to an otherwise very stale Web. Take this new communication channel and combine it with some of the other new features coming with HTML5, such as Canvas and off-line storage and it is time to start thinking BIG, really BIG!
W3C’s HTML5 standard has rapidly gained momentum as 2010’s hottest technology with help from companies, such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Developers and businesses alike are all trying to catch and align themselves with this new standard. Out of all the ideas and features in this new set of specifications, the most intriguing, exciting, and controversial section is HTML5 WebSocket. At first glance, some misinterpret WebSocket as merely a better transport protocol and replacement of HTTP or XHR. However, upon additional understanding, one quickly learns WebSocket is NOT a replacement or improved version of HTTP or XHR, nor do we want it to be! HTML5 WebSocket is a standard with the potential to bring unprecedented change to an otherwise very stale Web. What makes this new communication fabric so important is its simplicity and extensibility. We all assumed the Web was just there, and that HTTP provided everything we needed for Web communication. HTML5 WebSocket is the evolution of the communication fabric TO, ACROSS and WITHIN the Web and Cloud, and now we need to open our minds and start looking at the possibilities of this new way to communicate over the Web! Take this communication channel and combine it with some of the other new features coming with HTML5 such as Canvas and off-line storage and it is time to start thinking BIG, really BIG! This session is targeted developers and architects that are looking for better ways of increasing user experience and communication over the Web to create, improve, or replace existing Web applications. The session is also targeted developers and architects that just want to stretch their minds and receive the necessary information on making an educated assessment of the business and technical opportunities, and challenges, made possible by this new HTML5 standard. Wickedly cool demos, code examples, and comparisons with existing technologies and architectures will be used to illustrate these possibilities and their use cases.

A deeper look at architectural trade-offs through the lens of the arts.
Winston Churchill once said, "First we shape our buildings, and afterward our buildings shape us." The architecture of buildings yields valuable insights into how the way we design buildings determines the kinds of things we do inside of them. The other arts show a similar pattern: every individual artwork participates in an artistic form of some kind, which provides beneficial boundaries around the kind of expression that form can carry. This provides a useful metaphor for software development. Rather than comparing languages and platforms using benchmarks and feature lists, the savvy architect pays attention to the tool's form. What is the tool naturally good at? What kind of values and priorities are reflected in a technology choice? Are they consistent with values of the team or the organization? Learn to see beyond the details and to the deeper structure of the technologies we employ.

About this time last year we discovered a memory problem in our application. None of us knew the first thing about memory issues, so I got the case just because I was the one who discovered it. This is the story of my venture into the world of memory troubleshooting.
About this time last year we discovered that we had a memory problem in our application. None of us knew the first thing about memory issues, so I got the case just because I was the one who discovered it. This is the story of my venture into the world of memory troubleshooting. This is a basic and practical talk for those of you who haven't dealt with memory issues before. I will demonstrate tools that you can use to gather and analyze data. You will also learn some of the most important things to know about garbage collection and memory management. After this talk you should be able to go ahead and start troubleshooting your own memory problems. You could also use this as a primer if you want to go to more advanced talks on memory management.

Learn about NOSQL and how to use Neo4J, MongoDB and Cassandra with Java.
NOSQL is a movement promoting alternatives to relational databases. The majority of NOSQL databases are pioneered by companies that have special requirements for huge amounts of data, where a relational database doesn't scale. There is more to NOSQL databases than scaling. They are designed to work well in distributed environments like computing clouds, and this attracts smaller organisations and startups. Developing an application backed by a NOSQL database is quite different from the more traditional ORM model that many Java developers have become accustomed to. I will present 3 different kinds of NOSQL databases (Neo4J, MongoDB and Cassandra) and show you how to use them from Java.

It may never have occurred to you that a language with keywords like 'class' and 'private' would have any issues with OO programming, but a particular view of objects suggests that within the larger language that is Java, there is a smaller OO subset trying to get out.
OO means different things to different people, but they normally focus on defining terms such as encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance, and talk about data abstraction, abstract data types and so on. In this talk we take a brief look at what one particular view of OO suggests and what it means for regular Java programmers and their practice.

Keyboard navigation in Web apps are often overlooked or dismissed entirely in favour of a mouse-only interface. But people who use it require keyboard navigation to be effective. Keys should be consistent and work in all browsers. This talk shows you how to do just that.
Keyboard navigation such as shortcuts, access keys, tab index and component controls are often overlooked or dismissed entirely in favour of a mouse-only interface. But people who use the apps we build require keyboard navigation to be effective and avoid physical injury. What was once standard practice in systems and applications development goes from bad to downright terrible when you realise your shiny new app is being made to run in a browser and all the standard keys are ”taken” by the browser. To add insult to injury, browsers do not use the same keys for the same shortcuts. The talk shows the why and how from a non-programming standpoint by using examples from applications that have successfully implemented keyboard navigation, those who have not, and by showing how we did it in when rebuilding the central application for the Norwegian Government pension fund in Flex.

We believe that writing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable applications is too hard. Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction. The Akka framework is here to change that. Akka is leveraging Scala, and using the Actor Model together with STM it raises the abstraction level and provides a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications.

The Akka framework is here to change that. Akka is leveraging Scala, and using the Actor Model together with STM it raises the abstraction level and provides a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. For fault-tolerance it adopts the "Let it crash" model which have been used with great success in the Telecom industry to build applications that self-heals, systems that never stop. Akka's Remote Actors (backed by a scalable non-blocking IO impl), provides the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.

Learn how JSR-310 will change the way you work with dates and times!
Most applications have some kind of date and time logic, whether it be as simple as accessing the current date or as complex as managing the flight times of an airline. JSR-310 is a new standard being developed from Joda-Time to improve on the basic Date and Calendar classes. This session will explain the problems with the JDK classes, explain how JSR-310 solves them and showcase some advanced features for handling time-zones.

This session provides a comprehensive overview of the Spring platform's support for enterprise integration and event-driven architecture. Featured topics include JMS and Web Services support as well as both the Spring Batch and Spring Integration projects.
Spring is well-known as an Inversion of Control container. Most java developers are familiar with its Dependency Injection, Aspect-Oriented Programming, and Data Access support. Many are also familiar with Spring's role in the web tier, including a Model View Controller framework, REST support, and conversation management with Web Flow. However, fewer developers are familiar with Spring's support for enterprise integration. In this session, Mark will provide a comprehensive overview of Spring's support for messaging, scheduling, and batch processing. You will learn how these features provide a platform for event-driven architecture. Examples will include integration with JMS, Web Services, email, and more. You will also learn about Spring's support for Hohpe and Woolf's Enterprise Integration Patterns including demos of Transformation, Routing, Splitting, and Aggregation of messages. Finally, you will see how the Spring Batch and Spring Integration projects may be used together for automation of batch operations.

Investment Banking and Payments expert John Davies will cover some of the more challenging aspects of matching engine design
A matching engine is a service that matches one item against millions of others, except in this case it's against billions and they're arriving in the millions. John will cover two scenarios of extreme matching engines, one for matching buy/sell orders against each other as the prices change on the trading floor, the other a credit card authorisation system. Both systems were implemented in Java with smatterings of C & C++.
John is a regular speaker at technology and banking conferences, his background in technology goes back some 30 years and investment banking over 20 from programmer to head of technology and global chief architect at banks like BNP Paribas and JP Morgan. In 2000 he co-founded a company (C24) producing Java integration solutions for investments banks (SWIFT, FpML ISO-20022 etc.) and sold that to IONA technologies in 2007. Since then John co-founded Incept5, specialising in extreme enterprise solutions, clients include VISA US and Carlyle Group. John still codes and has several successful iPhone and iPad applications coded mostly while travelling to and from San Francisco. John has three young boys, a French wife and enjoys photography.

In this session, you'll see how a designer working in Photoshop and a developer working in NetBeans can produce a great looking application together, thanks to JavaFX and the tools in the JavaFX Production Suite.
Many JavaFX presentations focus on what the code looks like and how the language works, but they rarely show how to actually get started. JavaFX is said to be both designer and developer friendly but how do you get the designers involved? In this presentation we'll show what a typical JavaFX workflow may look like, starting with a fresh installation of the JavaFX Production Suite and Adbobe Photoshop, and going all the way to a complete application.

Adding non-obtrusive javascript navigation, while keeping the site search engine friendly and accessible for all audiences, by way of elegant DOM-manipulation and Ajax.
Usually, JavaScript based navigation is not friends with neither search engines or todays requirements for accessibility. This live coding-session begins with a simplified website with plain old HTML navigation, and transforms it into something a bit more visually pleasing by way of event-handling, DOM-manipulation and Ajax-trickery. The goal of this lightning talk is to illustrate that one does not necessarily need to code some insanely advanced stuff to create some insanely advanced looking coolery.

This presentation will show how a scalable search engine can be built by combining powerful open source tools - MySQL, Hibernate Shards and Apache Solr.
At Integrasco AS we've spent the last year developing a new data store and search engine for social media data mining. Our goal was a highly scalable design able to run on commodity hardware and with flexibility with regards to potential new future meta data and the ability to instantly make this available for searching. This presentation will be an experience report from this project and how we achieved our goals and implemented a search engine for analysis of social and consumer generated media. Using Hibernate Shards and MySQL for data storage, and Apache Solr for full text and meta data search we are now running a system which is easy to scale horizontally as our data and customer base continue to grow.

When developing with Mock objects, is it possible to avoid the code mirroring and bloating effect? Some simple steps to make it happen.
One of the issues with TDD and using mock objects is the high amount of code mirroring between the unit test code and the code under test. This duplication have some bad sideeffects: * Tests become brittle - later changes in the implementation may break them. * Tests become extremely verbose and can be hard to follow * Refactoring the tests may become difficult This lightning talk is focused on giving developers some solutions to this problem.

Explore how decision making dynamics can go wrong—and how to fix them!—at the individual level and in groups.
Alistair Cockburn has described software development as a game in which we choose among three moves: invent, decide, and communicate. Most of our time at No Fluff is spent learning how to be better at inventing. Beyond that, we understand the importance of good communication, and take steps to improve in that capacity. Rarely, however, do we acknowledge the role of decision making in the life of software teams, what can cause it to go wrong, and how to improve it. In this talk, we will explore decision making pathologies and their remedies in individual and team dimensions. We'll consider how our own cognitive limitations can lead us to to make bad decisions as individuals, and what we might do to compensate for those personal weaknesses. We'll learn how a team can fall into decision-making dysfunction, and what techniques a leader might employ to healthy functioning to an afflicted group. Software teams spend a great deal of time making decisions that place enormous amounts of capital on the line. Team members and leaders owe it to themselves to learn how to make them well.

The Play! framework focus on giving back the agility and productivity to the web developers. Though promoting simple and easy principles, it allows developers to build complex web applications.
The Play! framework is more than just yet another web framework in the Java eco-system: it is also another way of developing web applications. Like RoR, Django, it encourages fast and expressive development, with a clean and pragmatic API. Most importantly, perhaps, it brings simplicity to the Java world. It is the first web application framework in Java that is built by web developers for web developers. Because it is a simple, stateless framework that promotes a RESTful approach it offers the possibility of building complex web applications and, by extension, complex systems.
Guillaume Bort is lead developer of the Play! framework, co-founder and CTO of Zenexity, a company specialized in web architecture.

Cloud computing is changing the fundamental assumption of how business applications are built and run. Scala has successfully merged statically and strongly typed object-oriented concepts with functional programming paradigm. Both of them combined define a bleeding edge for new wave of Java-based business application development. These new trends will define business application development for years to come and that’s why developers need to be aware of them today.
The topic of this presentation is about using Scala programming language with GridGain’s cloud development platform to provide a simple and productive cloud computing platform. Scala is a hybrid function and object-oriented language that is rapidly gaining traction in becoming the “next” Java in JVM-based language evolution. GridGain is one of the most rapidly growing cloud development platforms for JVM-based languages. 2/3 of the presentation will be devoted to live coding demonstration of writing basic MapReduce application in Scala using GridGain middleware. All coding during demonstration will be done live. Overview of grid and cloud computing concepts as well as notion of Native Cloud Applications will be discussed. Short intro into Scala language will also be provided.
Mr. Ivanov has almost 20 years of experience in software development with last 10 years spent developing grid computing and distributed middleware software. In 2005 Mr. Ivanov founded GridGain project that has become one of the most rapidly growing Java-based cloud and grid computing software – with GridGain software starting every few seconds around the world.

Business Process Management describes the realization of efficiencies in the orchestration of systems and people towards a common goal. This presentation brings BPM to the people using Spring and Activiti.
Most people tend to model systems using services and entities. They forget that entities exist over time, and transition from one state to another. Often, these states are modeled as status flags on the entity. Unfortunately, this doesn't really work out in practice. It's like trying to describe a complicated customer fulfillment process using a UML sequence diagram - it's missing a few things: who is doing what, and - most importantly - when. There is a better way: a workflow engine can be used to extricate the process state from your application, and manage it. In this talk, we will explore the basics of workflow engines, and of process oriented architectures. We will introduce Activiti - a powerful, lightweight, embeddable workflow engine created by Tom Baeyans (the creator of jBPM) from Alfresco and explore its use in a Spring-based application

This presentation will provide the attendee with a simple way of building truly RESTful APIs using Qi4j and the DCI pattern.
Implementing a REST API today is important in many cases, both as an integration point to your application and as a way for clients to access the application. But there are few frameworks out there that help you fulfil all the constraints of REST, and therefore only makes your API a REST-wannabe. This session will look at how you can use Qi4j along with the DCI pattern to implement a truly RESTful API, that follows all the constraints. We will look at how DCI maps to the RESTful way of thinking about web API's, and how Qi4j can help with the actual implementation

An application's ARCHITECTURE predominately determines its performance - not the brand of infrastructure it runs on, and not "tuning" the infrastructure. This talk will illustrate the effect of architecture on performance with numerous case studies, and discuss performance-oriented patterns of architecture.
Unenlightened personnel in IT management may believe that simply switching from one brand of software infrastructure to another will be sufficient to solve an application’s performance challenges. Other groups of people – vendor support departments, and authors of application performance management literature – may recommend simply “tuning” the software infrastructure. But if an application is ignorantly architected, or too inefficient in its use of computing resources, then no amount of “tuning” will bring about the desired performance characteristics. This talk will demonstrate the effect of architecture on performance with numerous case studies, and discuss performance-oriented patterns of architecture at both macro- and micro- scopes.

Using a simple application that implements a blog this talk with cover the highlights of both the new Enterprise OSGi specification, and the Apache Aries project.
The aim of software engineers everywhere is to develop modular, reusable and extendable applications, both for the desktop and the web. Building this kind of application is difficult and for numerous reasons applications typically devolve into being complex and monolithic. The Apache Aries incubator project aims to change this by bringing the modularity of OSGi and the power of the Java Enterprise Edition together to make it possible to build innovative new applications for the web. The project builds on, and extends, the OSGi Alliances Enterprise specifications to make it easy to develop new web, and enterprise, modular applications using well known and understood Java Enteprise Edition technologies. This session is intended for existing JEE and OSGi developers with an interest in learning more about how existing JEE technologies can be integrated and used in an OSGi environment. The presenter will use his experience as an OSGi Enterprise Expert Group member and as an Apache Aries committer to explain · How to use Apache Aries to build a simple Web application. · How to use the OSGi Blueprint Container Specification to create lightweight components. · How, using open source offerings, to build OSGi applications that can exploit the advantages of a managed JEE-like environment as well as the modularity and dynamism of the OSGi framework

Watch in amazement as I build a complete website with frontend and database integration in less than ten minutes, using the power of Spring Roo.
Springsource has given us many fancy tools over the years, and now they also offer a rapid application development tool that really works. Spring Roo is a command-line tool for building the scaffolding and domain of your project. During this brief ten minute talk, I will write, from scratch, a web-application with multiple, interrelated domain objects, a relational database, an ORM layer, and a web layer. Don't think I can do it? Let me prove you wrong. Key talking points: * Write a prototype while discussing the customer's problem domain with them, have a prototype ready by the end of the first meeting * Set up persistence layer with one command! Maintain persistence layer with one command! * Round-trip aware coding tool that actually works * Confound your architects; Establish a complete (and open source) application stack from right out the gate * RAD tool that is actually Rapid (as long as you accept the limitations)

Be productive while building desktop/RIAs for the JVM and have some fun while at it.
Building a desktop application is a hard task, there are some many things to keep track of that many projects simply fail to meet their goals. Setting up the project structure keeping each artifact on a well identified location given its responsibility and type, defining the base schema for managing the application's life cycle, making sure the build is properly setup, and more. These are recurring tasks that should be handled by a tool or better yet, a framework. Griffon is such a framework. Inspired by the Grails framework Griffon aims to bring the same productivity gains to desktop development.
Andres is a Java/Groovy developer with more than 10 years of experience in software design and development. He has been involved in web and desktop application development since the early days of Java.

Tips, tricks and best practices for effectively maintaining and enhancing legacy Java code.
"Yeah, the guy that wrote that code left the company five years ago so no one has really dared change that..." Heard this before? With a decade (give or take) of significant Java development in the rear view mirror more and more of us Java developers find ourselves spending more and more time maintaining and enhancing existing application rather than enjoying the sweet-smelling luxury of the green field. The challenges involved include code thats prohibitively difficult to understand, test, refactor or enhance, usage of outdated APIs, frameworks, designs and more. This session targeted at the Java developer in the above situation will look at some practical techniques and strategies for: Improving structure and readability, Writing and automating tests, Managing dependencies and more. All with the purpose of safely and effectively handling our Java legacy.

I would like to take you through some of the issues, problems and solutions that I saw when building Erjang. Specifically, I will take you through what I think is wrong with "Java concurrency", and in which situations the conceptual model in Erlang is better. In Erlang you model systems with Actors; but how do we evolve from object-heads to actor-heads? How do we get to a point where processes are as intuitive and natural as objects and classes?
Over the last few years, I have been meeting "Erlang people" more and more often, and I am getting the impression that they have a magical ability to reason intuitively about concurrent systems in a way that I have not. It corresponds somewhat to the way we "object heads" think intuitively about classes and objects - just in terms of processes. That bothered me, so I wanted to learn Erlang. Being a language implementor, the most obvious way to do that is to just go ahead and implement an Erlang VM, right? The result of this "little exercise" is Erjang, an open-source JVM-based Erlang VM. It has turned into a non-trivial project, Erjang is now 50k lines of Java code, it runs substantial erlang programs, including booting OTP so you can use the Eshell, it self-hosts the erlang compiler (erlc) and tcp/ip functionality works. In this talk, I would like to take you through some of the issues, problems and solutions that I saw going through that exercise. And specifically, I will take you through what I think is wrong with "Java concurrency", and in which situations the conceptual model in Erlang is better. In Erlang you model systems with Actors; but how do we evolve from object-heads to actor-heads? How do we get to a point where processes are as intuitive and natural as objects and classes? Is short: I will explain how Erjang works, what I learned along the way, and demonstrate that Erjang runs well enough to be obviously useful.

But why not take the next massive stride in productivity and get on board with Git, a distributed version control system. Jump ahead of the masses staying on Subversion, and increase your team's productivity, debugging effectiveness, flexibility in cutting releases, and repository and connectivity redundancy (at $0 cost). Understand how distributed version control systems (DVCSes) are game-changers and pick up the lingo that will become standard in the next few years.

The aim of a cyber-dojo is to introduce deliberate practice to software development. The talk will explain the nature of deliberate practice, demonstrate a live kata using the cyber-dojo server, and give away copies of the server software to anyone who would like to run their own cyber-dojo.
The usual format for a code dojo is fairly well known: participants split into small groups, each group codes on their own laptop, all groups work on the same coding exercise with keyboard drivers rotating within the each group periodically. Towards the end of the dojo the coding stops and everyone presents their work in turn. This form of practice is often called a kata. A cyber-dojo is different in one important respect: each group still has their own laptop but they all perform the kata completely inside a web browser. A dedicated cyber-dojo server hosts the kata, saving the source files (and the outcome of running the tests) every time the run-the-tests button is pressed in the browser. Running a code-dojo in this manner creates many new exciting benefits including: 1. starting the kata is virtually instant - participants do not need anything installed at all. 2. all the step-by-step incremental run-tests submissions can be inspected helping to place a much greater emphasis on the decisions taken during the kata rather than simply the code at the end of the kata. 3. the cyber-dojo server allows everyone to peek at the current submissions of all groups! 4. since all development environments are now identical it is even possible to introduce timeboxed iterations to the kata and rotate codebases amongst the groups at each iteration! 5. it speeds up the end of kata retrospective (since you don't have to physically involve each individual laptop).

Learn how NoSQL makes scaling easy and how to unleash the power of CouchDB
There has been a lot of hype around NoSQL lately. In this session, you will get a brief introduction to NoSQL and learn why you should consider retiring your trusty relational database in your next project. There are still things that relational databases do better than NoSQL, but you will see that in most cases the downside for scaling is not worth it. Important NoSQL systems to be aware of and that will be covered in this overview are cassandra, hbase/hadoop, CouchDB, MongoDB and Tokyo Cabinet. You will see specific examples of how the schemaless nature of CouchDB allows you to store multiple types of documents in a single database and why this is a good thing. Learn how CouchDB's powerful map reduce views can rid your code of SQL or SQL abstractions. A database without replication is useless and master-slave replication still makes for a slightly rigid and vulnerable storage system. Learn about CouchDB's master-master replication and how it's filters enables partial replications. Replication is both data protection and scaling to handle more load. To handle more data, you need to shard your data. Sharding is dividing your data across different servers. While you can preshard your data, the scary bit is often to reshard a running system. See how Pillow can help you handle your sharding and resharding needs. Reliability and consistency are important for a large scale storage system. You learn why eventual consistency is sufficient and how to ensure your system is reliable. There is also a reason why CouchDB and Pillow are both written in Erlang and you will get some background for these choices. The talk will conclude with some key learnings from a year of working with Ruby and CouchDB in the Amazon cloud, EC2.
Knut has worked with search engines and related web scale systems for 10 years in FAST, Yahoo! and Google holding positions such as engineer, project manager, program manager and engineering manager. He founded Sincerial AS, a company developing and hosting a recommendation engine for web sites and is currently a senior consultant at Conceptos Consulting Trondheim. Knut has also found time to develop Pillow, an open-source routing and resharding server for CouchDB.

This concise and entertaining presentation will provide the audience with practical tools to address project overruns in a cost efficient manner.
Software estimation is an inherently difficult discipline. Research has found indications that increasingly popular agile frameworks may in fact reduce overruns, yet agile organizations are hardly immune to overruns, delays and bad business decisions based on poor estimates. A practice such as planning poker may be beneficial. However, it only deals with some aspects related to the complex process of software estimation. The agile literature is mainly concerned with estimating sprints or releases, and does not address underlying issues such as estimates of overall project schedule and cost. There are also many other estimation pitfalls related to organizational issues in desperate need of attention. This talks presents seven cost-efficient ways to reduce your project overruns, ranging from simple checklists, to target-price contracts. It is suitable for customers, contractors, managers, team-members and anybody else frustrated with unpaid overtime, cancelled vacations and stranded projects.
Kjetil Moløkken-Østvold has extensive experience with software estimation and process improvement, both as a consultant and researcher. He is a frequent speaker at conference venues, including Agile, Smidig, JavaZone and Software.

Demystify the HATEOAS constraint Implement hypermedia systemsin Java
Soon enough the development community will embrace the Web as a platform for building distributed systems. With the REST architectural style as our guide, we'll build solutions that easily span enterprises, and readily compose systems into end-to-end business processes. May of REST's "beneficial constraints" are widely understood - including the HTTP uniform interface. But one constraint - the hypermedia constraint - is renound for causing nosebleeds when developers try to understand it. This talk will demystify the hypermedia constraint, and show how services can use it to advertise protocols for consumers to drive over the Web. It will also introduce some Java patterns and general strategies that allow developers to drive protocols while remaining loosely coupled from the services that implement them.

Based on how the city administration of Oslo introduced the Confluence enterprise wiki as a collaborative multi-tool to aid with internal project management, we consider whether a structured approach to using wikis can provide the necessary means to solve actual use-cases in information management and user involvement.
The city administration of Oslo has recently introduced the Atlassian Confluence enterprise wiki to be a collaborative multi-tool for addressing several of their challenges with internal project management and organizing information. In light of this effort this lightening-talk will consider some of the benefits of taking a structured approach when adopting such grass-roots knowledge management tools, and how Confluence in particular is well suited to this due to its powerful plugin-framework.

Do you know what your enterprise apps get up to in their time off? Fighting fantasy, hypermedia-driven, RESTful Web adventures – of course. This session challenges the notion that REST is suitable only for CRUD-based data services, suggesting instead that the Web’s architecture provides everything we need to implement sophisticated business processes.
Do you know what your enterprise apps get up to in their time off? Fighting fantasy, pick-your-path, hypermedia-driven, RESTful Web application adventures – of course. In this speculative dungeon delve I show how hypermedia-driven Web applications implement rich workflows. In the course of the hour we’ll tackle the many-headed Hydra of HATEOAS, the “Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State” monster; level up through the Web services maturity heuristic; and meet the dwarves with grudges. On the way, we’ll learn how to model business processes as domain application protocols, implement them in terms of resource lifecycles, and advertise them using HTTP idioms, media types and link relation values. With techniques drawn from the forthcoming O’Reilly book "REST in Practice", this session challenges the notion that REST is suitable only for simple CRUD-based data services, suggesting instead that the Web’s architecture provides everything we need to model and implement sophisticated business processes in Web-based applications.

In a quick glance behind the scenes I'll tell you how JRebel works its magic and what it takes to develop such a tool.
JRebel came out as a class reloading tool in 2007, with a promise to save your time by skipping redeploy. Since then we have delivered on that promise, and then some, and JRebel has grown to a large project with hundreds of thousands of line of code. In this talk I'll reveal the basic principles that JRebel uses to skip builds and redeploys and show you some of the code doing the work. I'll also speak about some of the (unique?) challenges that our team had to face and how we solved them.

Ehcache now supports JTA. As a result, caches can now complement the database in a consistent way. Helping to scale, even without scarifying coherence when clustered. This session introduces JTA, how a cache fits the picture and how to take advantages of the benefits Ehcache JTA brings to application developers.
With systems growing larger, architects keep on looking for faster, yet also as consistent as possible storage solutions. Caching the data close to its consumers is a well known approach, that comes with its challenges. But also at the cost of loosing much of what the database provides: a transactional and consistent data storage. This session will show, with concrete code examples, how a JTA enabled cache addresses issues faced by system implementors and architects: * How does a transactional cache compares to a non-transactional one ? * What does XA provide you with for consistency ? * How does a JTA cache fit in an existing Java application ? * How does it fit in an XA environment ? * How was it implemented ?
Alex Snaps is a software engineer at Terracota Inc. Before working on the Terracotta platform and product line, he participated in medium to large projects as coach, development lead and architect.

Why do we still organize our code in strictly hierarchical structures, while we use tags to categorize our private pictures or interesting links? Learn why we should start tagging our code too, and the many advantages that would have.
Most languages allow source code to be organized in smaller units, like e.g. packages in Java. Usually, these units can be organized in their turn, thus creating a hierarchy of packages and classes, interfaces, enumerations, etc... In Java, these packages are closely tied to the file system's directory structure, which may not always be an advantage. Hierarchical structures are typical of the 20th century. In the 21st century, however, tagging has become a much more popular way to classify objects. Web sites like Delicious and Flickr are examples of places where people tag objects using keywords rather than storing them in a hierarchy. Just compare those sites to the yellow pages of the early days of the Internet, and you can see the difference in flexibility. So why do we stick to strict hierarchies for our source code while we're boasting we're so agile in everything else? Tagging the code with multiple tags allows programmers to browse the source code of a project using different perspectives. Do you want to browse your code by layer or by feature? Maybe you're trying to find all classes using a certain pattern? Maybe code coverage doesn't matter that much in a particular layer of your application, but is critical in one of the subdomains of the model? Clearly, a more flexible way to look at your code than a simple hierarchy would be more than welcome!

Do you think you need a Java web framework to be productive? Do you think that pair programming and test-driven development won't work for real applications? Do you think that some aspects of your web application cannot be tested automatically? Let us prove you wrong!
Do you think you need a Java web framework to be productive? Do you think that test-driven development won't work for real applications? Do you think that some aspects of your web application cannot be tested automatically? Let us prove you wrong! Starting from scratch, we pair program a Java web application which accesses the database, using only the servlet-API for the web part. Every aspect of the application is written test first. The whole development takes less than one hour from start to finish. Through the course of developing the application, we will introduce several useful libraries which makes it easy to write good tests for different aspects of a web/database application.
Anders is a solutions architect working for Steria Norway with more than ten years of Java project experience. Anders is happiest when he can able to make simple and understandable solutions to complex problems.
Johannes is an experienced Java developer and architecture working for Steria Norway. For the first several years as a Java-programmer, he tried to find a good web framework. Finally, he decided to learn what it takes to construct a web application without a web framework, just so he could see what work the frameworks were helping him with. He's never looked back. Johannes has been practicing test-driven development for ten years. He finds the practice hard, especially with new designs and patterns. As a result, whenever he runs across a problem that's difficult to test, he works on it repeatedly until he finds a good way to test it - a kata.

The presentation explains the garbage collection strategies in the Sun/Oracle JVM (including Java 7’s "garbage first (G1)" collector) and discusses strategies for tuning and configuration of the various collectors.
The JVM developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) has been refined and revised with every release of the JDK since the advent of Java in the mid 90ies. Today, Java developers face an abundance of GC algorithms - from plain and simple serial stop-the-world collectors with a single reaper thread to highly parallelized collectors that run several GC threads concurrently with application threads. Each of these collectors can be configured and tuned in various ways in order to control pause times or increase throughput. The number of choices a Java developer has for configuring the JVM’s garbage collection for his application is overwhelming. Hence, garbage collector tuning for the SUN/Oracle JVM is a daunting task. The tutorial aims to shed light onto the garbage collection strategies in the Sun/Oracle JVM by explaining all algorithms (including Java 7’s “G1” collector) and discussing strategies for tuning and configuration of the various collectors.

The Play! framework is more than just yet another web framework in the Java eco-system: it is also another way of developing web applications. Like RoR, Django, it encourages fast and expressive development, with a clean and pragmatic API. Most importantly, perhaps, it brings simplicity and fun to the Java world. However, simplicity does not mean being limited to simple web applications. The framework gives you enough power to actually create just anything you can think off: with continuation, web socket support, asynchronous call it is one of the first framework to empower you. We will dive into details on how to use those features and realize that it is actually quite simple, Scala might even be part of the program... Infinity and beyond are now reachable to Java Web developers!

The tools and techniques of SOA can be used to serve the customers of the business, or they can become goals in and of themselves. This talk provides a balanced view of service oriented architecture (SOA).
At JavaZone 2005, I gave a talk with the title "Why I hate SOA". In the talk, I outlined several weaknesses with the then much-hyped term Service Oriented Architecture. Six years have passed, and I have learned much. The question is: Has SOA learned the same things? In this talk, I will outline the real value proposition of Service Oriented Architecture: That of focusing on the services your business provides, both to human and computer users. By focusing on the business services, small, feature-oriented teams can deliver value. The thinking and tools of SOA can be used to serve the customers of the business or they can distract a project for its real goals. I will examine three shortcomings in many approaches to SOA: The focus on tools, the focus on reuse, and the use of SOA as an application architecture. Tools, reuse and application architecture have their place, but once they take the driver seat instead of delivering services to the user of the business, things can go wrong. The integration tools of SOA, when applied wrong, conceal the reality of most projects: 90% of integration problems can only be solved by people talking together. The reuse vision of SOA, when applied wrong, conceal the reality of most projects: Reuse is a most often trap, not an opportunity. Using SOA as an application architecture conceal the reality of most projects: Organizing developers as mindless cogs will force them to behave mindlessly. The talk will be filled with real world examples.

Compare and contrast various asynchronous web approaches and get a feel for where one might be a better choice over another.
The world is all about the asynchronous web these days. There are an increasing number of options for Java developers. In this presentation we'll cover 3 such options: comet, servlet 3, and websockets. We'll look at code and discuss pros and cons of each approach. We'll also cover any updates that come with Servlet 3.1 (which will likely still be a work in progress.) We'll look briefly at possible mitigation approaches when you find yourself bound to a particular approach. This session assumes at least a passing familiarity with the concepts as there won't be too much time to deep dive into each approach.

Given today’s increasingly complex application portfolios, a modern developer is faced with more and more non-programming tasks in addition to delivering code. This talk offers 12 concrete scripts that may free your energies so that you can get back into the highly productive state referred to as “flow”.
During this presentation I will present 12 scripts and hacks, ready to be copied and pasted into your project. They may either save you time directly, or help you cut down on the vast number of “TODOs” you have to juggle and keep track of in your mind when being responsible for an application portfolio. This way, you will hopefully have more time focusing on what you should spend most of your time doing: pushing code- or configuration changes into a production environment. Some scripts may be directly applicable to your project “as-is”, whereas others may function as a basis for customization and adaption to similar tasks. A few may even help you identify similar tasks and processes you falsely consider to be a “tedious manual job that I hopefully won’t have to repeat later”. And even if you cannot justify the few couple of hours it takes with a direct ROI within your first week, see these scripting jobs as an exercise to stay sharp. It is like doing ten push-ups before going to bed - you know it is good for you, and that it only takes a couple of minutes - you just conveniently “forget” it. If you are still not convinced, see these small scripting jobs as a way to improve your mental hygiene, by allowing yourself to do boring work in a fun way. If you find writing scripts more boring than creating and following up documents and spreadsheets, then you might be ready for a career change. Many of the example scripts have, by choice, been written in languages that do not need extensive installation procedures, lots of configuration, or big frameworks. The languages include Bash/Cygwin, Windows Command Line / PowerShell, cleartool, SQL, ant, and ”JUAN”; a home-made notification addon to JUnit.

The tutorial explains the Java memory model: visibility of memory modifications in multi-threaded systems, reordering issues, volatile and atomic variables, initialisation safety and final fields, and lock-free programming.
With the increasing availability and use of multicore processors Java developers need to acquire some understanding of the Java memory model. This is because multithread applications that work nicely on a single-core processor might exhibit "inexplicable" deficiencies when running on a multicore processor platform. The reason may be differences in the caching strategies applied by different processors. In order to illustrate the issues this tutorial explains the Java features for multithread programming. Key topics include: memory model, visibility and reordering issues, volatile and atomic variables, initialisation safety and final fields, lock-free programming.

Learn how to design your applications so that they can reliably handle documents and data sets of any size, without blowing your entire hardware budget on memory. Discover how streaming applies to services (REST and SOAP), database connections (JDBC and JPA), and large documents (XML and JSON).
Modern frameworks and libraries make it easy to expose application features as services. However, if used naively, the resulting services are often severely limited in the size of data they can accept. If clients try to pass even moderately large documents, such systems will lag, hang, or crash hard with an OutOfMemoryError. This talk describes how to design your applications so that they can reliably handle documents and data sets of any size without choking, and without blowing your entire hardware budget on memory. Areas covered: * Designing your APIs for streaming * Streaming patterns * Streaming services (web services and REST) * Handling large XML and JSON files * Handling large data sets with JDBC and JPA * Parallelizing streams * Connecting streams, with or without helper threads

This lightning talk explains why poor connection handling with queues can cause serious downtime, and discuss a template to help fix the problem.
Programming mistakes never make it past code reviews, extensive testing and continous integration, right? Unfortunately not. Programming mistakes go live and cause downtime. So, what are the typical mistakes that sneak past testing, and end up frustrating both customers and operation crews? In my experience, poor connection handling when dealing with queues and topics are overrepresented. In this lightning talk I focus on a few situations where connection mistakes lead to serious incidents. I also briefly go through the Spring JMS Template. This framework is a good starting point for making sure your application isn't too greedy with the connections.

Crazy and profound examples of code that contribute to history or provoke current understanding of the practice of programming.
In most disciplines built on skill and knowledge, from art to architecture, from creative writing to structural engineering, there is a strong emphasis on studying existing work. Exemplary pieces from past and present are examined and discussed in order to provoke thinking and learn techniques for the present and the future. Although programming is a discipline with a very large canon of existing work to draw from, the only code most programmers read is the code they maintain. They rarely look outside the code directly affecting their work. This talk examines some examples of code that are interesting because of historical significance, profound concepts, impressive technique, exemplary style or just sheer geekiness.

A crash-course in the theory and implementation of functional data structures using Scala as a host language.
This talk will cover the theory and implementation of 6 unique functional data structures in Scala. We'll start out with the concept of functional persistence and then dive right into actual data structures. Each data structure will be motivated and built up by the associated theory and ideas. All of these will be illustrated (with requisite colorful diagrams) and implemented with the necessary trappings to be a first-class Scala Collection. Finally, we'll look at some of the real-world constraints imposed by hardware architecture and the JVM itself, touching on how these constraints affect data structure design in ways that the theory doesn't show.

Cake mixes consist of a mix of things you already have in your cupboard plus a load of unnecessary, potentially harmful preservatives. They cost more than making cake from scratch, the resulting cake tastes worse, they take away people's confidence in their ability to make their own cakes, and they don't even save you any time. Hibernate has the same misperceived benefits and the same draw-backs. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't be caught dead using any cake mix. As professional programmers, we should be more sceptical of generic frameworks like hibernate.

XP developers follow a certain way of life. Take something good and turn it up to the extreme. Extreme Performance Testing is born out of ten years experience working with XP, with the goal of further integrating performance testing into a normal XP development process. No longer will you need to treat performance testing as just another stage towards production. Taking performance testing to the extreme is often viewed as difficult requiring special skills, extra resources, and much more time. In this talk, we'll look at Extreme Performance Testing's key practices, effectively translating the agile values and principles into a different set of practices. We'll look at real world examples that demonstrate these practices in action, understanding their positive impact on projects. We'll also explore the prerequisites for making Extreme Performance Testing most effective, and the reinforcing practices that amplify their positive effects. You'll come away from this talk with concrete advice on how to better integrate performance testing into classic agile methods and how to apply Extreme Performance Testing to your projects.

Code templates is an underused feature in most IDEs. This talk will, by using a live code session, demonstrate how you can use code templates. You will learn both how to use existing code templates and how to create your own.
IIn my experience many java-developers is not aware of the many features included in their IDE. Code templates are one such undiscovered feature. In this talk I will demonstrate how code templates can be used. I will code a real life example and use code templates both to generate code for test code and production code. The demonstration will be performed in Eclipse, but I will also describe how the same features can be used in other IDEs - such as Intelij. After attending the talk you will have learned how you can use existing code templates in your IDE and how you can create your own.

Hadoop is a MapReduce framework that has literally sprung into the vernacular of "big data" developers everywhere. But coding to the raw Hadoop APIs can be a real chore. Data analysts can express what they want in more English-like vocabularies, but it seems the Hadoop APIs require us to be the translator to a less comprehensible functional and data-centric DSL. The Cascading framework gives developers a convenient higher level abstraction for querying and scheduling complex jobs on a Hadoop cluster. Programmers can think more holistically about the questions being asked of the data and the flow that such data will take without concern for the minutia. We'll explore how to set up, code to, and leverage the Cascading API on top of a Hadoop cluster for a more effective way to code MapReduce applications all while being able to think in a more natural (less than fully MapReduce) way. During this presentation, we'll also explore Cascading's Clojure-based derivative, Cascalog, and how functional programming paradigms and language syntax are emerging as the next important step in big-data thinking and processing.

Complexity Theory is a new and intriguing discipline, offering powerful insights that unify observations of the natural world, mathematics, and computer science into a few elegant concepts. Come see what Complexity means, where it's found in nature, and how it can make us better software developers.
Some systems are too large to be understood entirely by any one human mind. They are composed of a diverse array of individual components capable of interacting with each other and adapting to a changing environment. As systems, they produce behavior that differs in kind from the behavior of their components. Complexity Theory is an emerging discipline that seeks to describe such phenomena previously encountered in biology, sociology, economics, and other disciplines. Beyond new ways of looking at ant colonies, fashion trends, and national economies, complexity theory promises powerful insights to software development. The Internet—perhaps the most valuable piece of computing infrastructure of the present day—may fit the description of a complex system. Large corporate organizations in which developers are employed have complex characteristics. In this session, we'll explore what makes a complex system, what advantages complexity has to offer us, and how to harness these in the systems we build.

The ability to inject code into compiled classes is of immense help when troubleshooting problems, especially in an enterprise environment. I'll present three different real-world cases where code injection came to my rescue; solving each one with a different tool and within the constraints at hand. Come and learn them!
This presentation is aimed at giving you the knowledge of code injection that you may (or I should rather say "will") need and at persuading you that learning basics of code injection is really worth the little of your time that it takes. I'll present three different real-world cases where code injection came to my rescue, solving each one with a different tool, fitting best the constraints at hand. I'll also provide you with resources to learn the basics and tools easily and quickly. This is a practical presentation; we won't introduce AOP and will explain code injection only briefly, plunging right into the tools and how they can help you.
I'm a Java EE developer since 2005, working with IBM Austria, IBA CZ, and now Iterate Norway. I've worked on many different projects, often in enterprise environments with complex deployment structures and strict security, legal and other rules, serving hundreds of thousands of users. I've learned about code injection years ago when I started to work on extending, customizing, and maintaining a large, third-party, closed-source J2EE enterprise application. During the years I've found code injection to be indispensable for troubleshooting and for dealing with cross-cutting concerns like performance monitoring in an elegant way, both on this J2EE project and many others. My primary interests are code quality, application performance, and ease of development, including the golden rule Don't Repeat Yourself - one of the reasons why I appreciate code injection. I share my technical endeavors and experience reports at my blog http://theholyjava.wordpress.com/ and you can also find some of the articles at DZone.

Experiences and lessons on how to select languages and libraries for the Java-platform
For designing and implementing systems there are choices like do you use Java or Scala, Spring or Guice, Eclipse or Intellij. Equally important are a clear strategy on how to introduce technology into your organization, keeping developers productive and integrate new technology into existing projects. Even the great Java-platform needs help from developers, architects and project managers to be as successful as the last evangelist explained to you. This presentation is a collection of advices based on experience from the last 10 years introducing Java-platform technology into new and existing projects. Examples will be given on how to choose language and libraries, how to learn, how to integrate, what is important for developers, how to handle project managers, all with the purpose of explaining how you can use fun and exciting technology to deliver your project.

Day in and day out we are subjected to poorly designed applications. From those we experience directly to the time we waste waiting on others who are struggling with systems that seem like they were built to hinder the user. It doesn't have to be like this and many users are waking up and demanding better applications. Are you prepared to deliver? After this workshop, you will be. When you're done, you'll have the tools you need to make sure your application helps your users kick ass! Usa-what now? While most developers are schooled in algorithms and programming languages, they often lack a grounding in the fundamentals of usability; we'll start by exploring what usability is dispelling many of the myths surrounding this misunderstood aspect of software. We'll show why usability matters and help you see how it can make the difference on your projects. The who - developing pragmatic personas. We can't build a great UI without knowing who we're building it for. Personas are a time tested technique to help teams understand their users and facilitate building the right interface. While personas are often backed by extensive ethnographic research, they don't require months and months of effort. We'll explore the use of pragmatic personas to see how they can simplify the task of interface design. As an exercise, we'll develop personas for our application. The what - figuring out just what to build. Of course just knowing who we're building for is only part of the picture, we have to know what our users are trying to do. Wether you favor use cases, user stories or more traditional requirements documents, at the end of the day our customers are using our application to further some other goal. In this section we'll discuss tasks and scenarios showing how they contribute to the overall design process. Using story maps, we'll write up a set of user goals expanding them into tasks that will help us design a set of interfaces. The how - designing rocking good interfaces. Want to know the secret to designing great interfaces? We'll talk about the importance of iteration; just as our code is rarely right on the first try, neither are our interfaces. To facilitate the iterative process, we'll discuss the vital importance of paper prototyping. That's right, paper and pencil are your best tools. We'll also talk about why some designs are better than others discussing the heuristics that are second nature to the experienced designer. We'll also discuss design guidelines talking about how to make sure yours aren't just a dusty document sitting in a rarely visited corner of the LAN. We'll sketch up a variety of approaches focussing on quick and dirty designs that allow us to explore a plethora of options. Testing our design - making sure we're on the right path. Just as we test our code, we must test our interfaces. While we may not have UIunit at our disposal, testing our UIs is just as important as testing our code. From recruiting users to preparing the space, we'll discuss how to get ready for a test. We'll talk about the various roles in a user test from the all important moderator to playing computer and taking notes. User tests can be very stressful, we'll discuss ways to put our customers at ease. We'll also discuss the best way to communicate the results of testing to the rest of your team. We'll prepare a deck to test a given scenario. We'll take that deck and test it with our "customers." Of course we can also desk check our interfaces using standard heuristics - we'll look at some existing applications discussing what was done right and what could be done better.

CoffeeScript is JavaScript without the Bad Parts, without the mess of braces and semicolons and bad design decisions. CoffeeScript is just the Good Parts, with a concise and pretty new syntax thrown in for free. Ever wish you could put the fun back in JavaScript? Let me show you how.
JavaScript. Love it or hate it, in the web development world it's impossible to avoid it. It was designed in one week by one man at Netscape, just to keep the browser from standardising on something even worse -- and it shows. Oh, it's not all bad, but the Good Parts -- which actually make up a pretty neat language -- are well hidden in among all the Bad Parts, which are there to make you, the JavaScript developer, suffer. CoffeeScript is a language designed to take the Good Parts out of JavaScript and make a new, concise and beautiful language out of them. It runs anywhere JavaScript does -- in fact, it compiles to fairly readable JavaScript -- so you can already use it in your web applications and wherever else you've been stuck with JavaScript. In this talk, you'll learn what CoffeeScript looks like, how it relates to the JavaScript you know, and what new features it has to offer. In fact, if you already know JavaScript well, you'll probably be perfectly fluent in CoffeeScript after this -- it's that easy. And trust me, your life will be so much better for it.
Bodil spends her days working as a Java developer at Steria, while silently plotting to overthrow the ancien régime, replacing current programming fashions with the Next Big Thing. She hopes the Next Big Thing will have lots of parentheses, but will settle for anything without checked exceptions. She is on intimate terms with JavaScript and the web platform, having been the lead JavaScript developer on Scandinavia's biggest web based mapping application -- kart.gulesider.no and friends -- and has since taken an active interest in CoffeeScript and Node.JS as worthy challengers to the Ruby on Rails hegemony. After discovering CoffeeScript, she has almost completely stopped cutting herself.

This session covers the Spring platform's support for NoSQL data stores and open protocols for messaging. It features a sample application designed to focus on modularity as a key enabler of the benefits of a cloud runtime, such as on-demand elasticity and "always on" availability. The application will be deployed to Cloud Foundry.
Applications are increasingly facing demands for horizontal scalability and cross-platform interoperability. NoSQL data stores are gaining momentum as a way to address the scalability challenges, but for Java developers, this means we need to explore new territory beyond relational database libraries like JDBC and JPA. Messaging systems are by their very nature able to handle distributed deployment models, but for Java developers, the cross-platform challenge suggests we should look beyond JMS. Open protocols such as HTTP and AMQP are attractive language-neutral alternatives. In this session, you will learn how the Spring application platform is evolving to accommodate these trends. We'll briefly explore the Spring Data APIs for working with NoSQL data stores, and we'll discuss open protocol options for messaging via Spring Integration Gateways and Channel Adapters. We will also take a quick tour of Cloud Foundry from an application developer's perspective. The session will include a demo of a sample application designed to demonstrate the characteristics of modularity that allow an application to take advantage of a cloud environment. It will make use of the RabbitMQ and MongoDB services available on Cloud Foundry.

Have you ever wondered how to design a RESTful data format? This talk will tell you how.
What is a hypermedia format? This talk will define what a hypermedia format is. We will look at different types of formats, and try to create our own using design patterns commonly found in existing formats. We will also look at how the 7th constraint of REST applies (HATEOAS or the hypermedia constraint) to hypermedia and its use.

Learning the syntax of a new language is easy, but learning to think under a different paradigm is hard. This session helps you transition from a Java writing imperative programmer to a functional programmer, using Java, Clojure and Scala for examples.
Learning the syntax of a new language is easy, but learning to think under a different paradigm is hard. This session helps you transition from a Java writing imperative programmer to a functional programmer, using Java, Clojure and Scala for examples. This session takes common topics from imperative languages and looks at alternative ways of solving those problems in functional languages. As a Java developer, you know how to achieve code-reuse via mechanisms like inheritance and polymorphism. Code reuse is possible in functional languages as well, using high-order functions, composition, and multi-methods. I take a variety of common practices in OOP languages and show the corresponding mechanisms in functional languages. Expect your mind to be bent, but you’ll leave with a much better understanding of both the syntax and semantics of functional languages.

Understanding Java bytecode can bring to the light some of the aspects in Java that may not seem obvious from the first sight. This talk will introduce you the JVM and bytecode basics with a lot of examples and some practical tips for problem solving.
If you never goofed around with assembler or machine code Java bytecode can seem an obscure piece of low-level magic. But sometimes things go really wrong and understanding that bit may be what stands between you and solving the problem at hand. Looking to deepen you Java programming skills? Understanding bytecodes is necessary to solve performance issues, some classloading issues and to generate code at runtime. And some things you can do are just plain freakin' cool. This talk will introduce you the JVM and bytecode basics using live coding examples. It's my hope that you'll walk out armed for the next battle with low-level issues. From the basics, to more advanced gotchas: * How to obtain the bytecode listings * How to read the bytecode * How the language constructs are mirrored by the compiler: local variables, method calls, optimizations, autoboxing, exception handling, etc * insight to some bytecode manipulation libraries (ASM, Javassist)

Introducing the Apache incubator project Whirr: it starts clusters in the cloud. You'll learn exactly how Whirr works, even in a sophisticated context like HBase. System Architecture, Code, and Configuration, and the Cloud will be discussed, not to mention how to use whirr to avoid knowing all of this.
Whether it's HBase, Cassandra or one of the many others, you've probably already hears about NoSQL. Perhaps you've wanted to try it out, but don't have the infrastructure or expertise to setup an elaborate clustered environment. During this talk, you'll see how to make your own NoSQL platform using infrastructure clouds such as Amazon EC2 or GoGrid. We'll demonstrate how you can use Whirr to start up your own configurable cluster with just a couple of commands, and how you can integrate this into your automation for to achieve, for example, continuous testing flows. We'll also show how Whirr uses jclouds for node management, and how you can easily add additional services using the underlying jclouds ComputeService interface.
Adrian founded the open source jclouds multi-cloud library 2 years ago, and is also a committer to Apache Whirr. His recent efforts include vCloud ecosystem engineering at VMware, Java integration at Opscode, and cloud portability efforts at Cloudsoft. Adrian's currently consulting under Cloud Conscious LLC, which fuels jclouds considerably.

You think you knew refactoring ? Think again ! Years of programming and pairing teaches different approaches at how to solve the same problems. This talk is a code-oriented dive into hair-splitting differences that can make your day. It is not about keymaps, but about approaches for changing code. Experts and beginners alike will learn from this talk.
Using IntelliJ, the talk will give live demonstration of different approaches to the common refactoring operations. This will include deleting code, renaming code, introducing parameters, introducing variables, creating variables, inlining and selecting code. This is the stuff you don't pick up by casual messing around with the "refactor" menu, and is valuable for professionals with 10+ years experience as well as beginners. Everyone will learn something.

Creating and delivering technical presentations is not just the realm of conference speakers anymore. Let’s face it: if you have to give a technical presentation and it’s boring, you’re not going to make much of an impact.
Creating and delivering technical presentations is not just the realm of conference speakers anymore. Let’s face it: if you have to give a technical presentation and it’s boring, you’re not going to make much of an impact. However, if you can make it entertaining and informative, you sell your ideas much better. This session takes a different approach to how to build presentations, by providing patterns and anti-patterns you can use to make sure you’re getting the most leverage from your presentations. Don’t take a knife to a gunfight! The ability to create compelling presentations that explain your point is one of the things that keeps your job from disappearing.

Learn how to write highly concurrent, distributed and fault-tolerant systems on the JVM using Akka
We believe that one should never have to choose between productivity and scalability, which has been the case with traditional approaches to concurrency and distribution. The cause of that has been the wrong tools and the wrong layer of abstraction — and Akka is here to change that. Akka is using the Actors together with Software Transactional Memory (STM) to create a unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT (utilizing the grid/cloud). Akka provides location and network transparency by abstracting away both these tangents of scalability by turning them into an operations and configuration task. This gives the Akka runtime freedom to do adaptive automatic load-balancing, cluster rebalancing, replication and partitioning. In this talk you will learn what Akka is and how it can be used to solve hard scalability problems. Akka is available at http://akka.io (under Apache 2 license).

This presentation will cover the ongoing JVM convergence effort that is being undertaken by the Oracle JVM team to produce a combined JVM by taking the best features from HotSpot and JRockit. It wil include the grand vision of this effort, the current status, and what the near and long term milestones are.
As a result of the merge between Sun Microsystems and Oracle the combined company has got not one but two industrial-strength Java Virtual Machines (JVMs). What will Oracle's future JVM be like? Over the past few years HotSpot has released a number of new innovative features: NUMA-aware GC, string concatenation optimization, Garbage-First GC, SSE 4.2 support that is particularly useful in array data manipulations, effective escape analysis, etc. In the meantime JRockit is well known for its speed, innovative Deterministic GC, and impressive monitoring tools such as Mission Control, Flight Recorder, improved JMX agent, native memory tracking, etc. There were many possibilities considered for Oracle's future JVM. The path that was chosen should make happy both the existing as well as any new JVM users. Oracle has been assembling a single JVM taking the best features and characteristics from HotSpot and JRockit. The future converged JVM will have a source base derived from Hotspot but heavily enhanced with all the important and popular JRockit features: Mission Control and Flight Recorder support, native memory tracking, soft real-time GC, and many many more.

Learn the benefits and pitfalls of JPA 2.0.
The release of the JPA 2.0 specification heralded a wider array of functionality and a more advanced feature set. This made some developers jump for joy at the prospect of being able to do more and still be compliant with the specification. The problem is that the standard doesn’t often come with a detailed instruction booklet describing when to use the new features, or the specific problems they were meant to solve. For the most part, developers must decide for themselves how and under what circumstances they will apply a given feature to their applications. We will discuss what the new features are and when they should be applied, as well as the conditions that could lead to their misuse. We will offer tips on what the most useful features are and explore some of the more puzzling parts.

This notion of sending messages has a strong synergy with actor based messaging. This session shows you how to model goal direction and task definition as small, manageable chunks of application functionality which are both far easier to reason about and far more convenient to scale compared to the mass of plumbing found in many enterprise applications.
Prototypical applications found in industry today are heavily orientated toward solving the relevant problem, with a UI that is designed for simply satisfying input to the domain objects; resulting in UIs that often leave the user with little specific information on what the primary intent of the display is. Goal-directed design however can greatly assist in these scenarios by placing the user experience in a central place during the inception of any given system. Goal-directed design is orientated toward capturing user intention and sending messages (or commands) back to the server, rather than mutated transformation objects (DTOs) that are simply persisted by the system, with little appreciation for what specifically changed or what the user was achieving. This notion of sending messages has a strong synergy with actor based messaging. This session shows you how to model goal direction and task definition as small, manageable chunks of application functionality which are both far easier to reason about and far more convenient to scale compared to the mass of plumbing found in many enterprise applications.

In this talk we illustrate Groovy's DSL capabilities through numerous realistic examples. Throughout the talk, we will also tackle the often forgotten but key aspects of readability vs complexity, testability, evolution, and the various considerations to keep in mind while designing DSLs.
There have been many attempts to create languages which allow us to express our problems in higher-level languages: from COBOL to Object-Oriented languages, from Logic processing languages and SQL to rules engines. All have taken us forward in leaps and bounds but have failed to get very close to the language of the subject matter expert. This talk looks mostly at Groovy's features to see how far we have come with a general purpose programming language for writing DSLs.

We will take a look at client- and server-side RIA architectures from the security angle, identify some of the most common security problems and discuss strategies for avoiding them. We'll go through an example application implemented in both architectures and demonstrate the problems. Java-based RIA frameworks, Google Web Toolkit and Vaadin, are used in the examples.
Rich Internet Applications (RIA) provide desktop-like usability with web deployment model. The benefits of this combination are obvious and RIA is now common a choice for the presentation layer in many applications. Unfortunately, moving logic from the server to an untrusted client may open up security holes that would not be present in the page-oriented "Web 1.0" architecture. In this presentation we will take a look at client- and server-side RIA architectures from the security angle, identify some of the most common security problems and discuss strategies for avoiding them. We'll go through an example application implemented in both architectures and demonstrate the problems. Java-based RIA frameworks, Google Web Toolkit and Vaadin, are used in the examples, but the demonstrated principles are applicable to most other frameworks and languages as well.

Use DDD ideas and techniques to address really severe security vulnerabilities.
Since 2004 Injection Flaws and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) has topped the OWASP Top Ten of most harmful vulnerabilities. Time to do something about it. In this code kata we address both Injection Flaw as well as XSS by applying techniques from Domain Driven Design - thus Domain Driven Security. In specific we use DDD context mapping to understand what the problem really is and DDD value objects to shape up our module APIs to make these vulnerabilities go away by enforcing indata validation and outdata encoding in a way that feels natural for the developers.

An introduction to MongoDB, the highly scalable document oriented database, with discussion various integration points for MongoDB & the JVM including Spring's "Spring Data" component for MongoDB, the Morphia Object Mapper for Java, MongoDB's Scala Driver "Casbah", Mongo-Backed Akka Durable Mailboxes, Lift's MongoDB Active- Record integration, and MongoDB's Hadoop integration.
MongoDB is a scalable, high-performance, open source, document-oriented NoSQL database. It features document-oriented, JSON-based document storage and dynamic schemas providing simplicity, power and flexibility, combined with full indexes similar to what a traditional RDBMS user would expect. MongoDB also provides solid replication & high availability features as well as an auto-sharding system for transparent horizontal scalability. This talk introduces MongoDB for developers who aren't familiar with it, and discusses various integration points for MongoDB & the JVM including Spring's "Spring Data" component for MongoDB, the Morphia Object Mapper for Java, MongoDB's Scala Drivers (Casbah, as well as a new experimental Asynchronous driver), Akka Durable Mailboxes, Lift's MongoDB Active-Record integration, and MongoDB's Hadoop integration.
Brendan McAdams, a software engineer at 10gen, explores the deeper relationship between the MongoDB database and various languages on the Java Virtual Machine such as Java, Scala, Clojure, JRuby and Python as well as the challenges posted getting MongoDB to play nice with these tools and their syntax.

This talk will dive into some of the more remote regions of the kingdom of Scala. Specifically, we will cover topics such as higher kinds, programming at the type level, typeclasses and delimited continuations.
Scala is an intensely powerful language. One of the most obvious ways in which this manifests is the syntax, which is wonderfully amenable to internal DSLs and flexible APIs (not to mention endless reams of obfuscated sources and fanciful operators). However, despite the superficial flash of Scala’s syntactic skin, its true power lies in the type system and in the language’s deep semantic constructs. This talk will dive into some of the more remote regions of the kingdom of Scala. Specifically, we will cover the following topics: * Higher-Kinds (what they are and how they can be applied) * Type-Level Encodings (really exploiting Scala’s type system) * Typeclasses (just like Haskell...except not) * Delimited Continuations (and you thought kinds were confusing!) Please note that this is an advanced talk targeted at the Scala practitioner who is already fairly comfortable with the language. With that said, we hope the talk will remain reasonably accessible to the Scala beginner – so long as they don’t object to the presentation of odd and esoteric language features with disturbing enthusiasm.

Moving from Java to Scala sometimes feels scary. To make the transition a little bit easier it might help to keep some of the existing Java frameworks your company have experience in using. At least that is our theory when we chose to keep SpringMVC as web framework in my current Scala project. Time will tell if we are right or wrong in that theory :) But I did stumble upon a nice little side effect. That Scala could make Spring Java Config go from cool to great. In this lightning talk I will show how a Spring config could look in Scala, and how we could use Scala's features to create very readable and type safe Spring configuration.

Learn how Netflix moved its production services from being completely data center based, to being mostly cloud based in a little over a year. Find out what works and what doesn't in cloud migration, and how to get the best out of cloud services.
Netflix has moved its production services from being completely datacenter-based, to being primarily cloud-based in a little over a year. This talk will briefly explain why we did it and why we chose Amazon's AWS. The talk will then delve into the evolution of our build and deployment architecture, starting with how our orignal monolithic DC-based SQL-tied webapp was built and deployed, and then detailing the evolution of our continuous integration systems which helped prepare us for the cloud move. And finally, it will cover our current full build pipeline and deployment system which keeps us agile in the cloud now by providing quick turnaround, and rapid roll-out and recovery.

Enterprise Integration Architecture at the seriously large end of the scale, billions of messages, billions of £/?/$/NOK and very little of the fluffy stuff.
One hundred thousand messages per second, up-times measured in years, billions of dollars a day, operations in over 100 countries, hundreds of millions of users, that?s enterprise! Regardless of what you program in and at what scale you are going to come across some form of integration, at the simpler levels the frameworks take care of almost everything but as things get more complex old solutions can get cumbersome and new ones are needed, not restricted to Java but definitely Java-centric. John will walk you thing some of the existing problems and solutions in this area, starting with simple integration problems we come across every day to solutions attempted at some of the larger banks and why they failed and what worked. Finally some new ideas to think about.
John has been working in leading edge technology, mostly in investment banking and payments for well over 25 years. Working in 3 continents, moving from programmer to head of trading systems and head of technology at BNP Paribas to Global Head or Technical Architecture at JP Morgan. In 2000 John co-founded C24, the main product ?Integration Objects? (IO), a code-generator solved integration issues for investment banks, covering SWIFT, ISO-20022, FpML & FIX. C24 was sold to Nasdaq?s Iona Technologies in 2007 which was then sold to Progress Software a year later, John became the Technical Director in both cases. In early 2008 John co-founded Incept5, initially an incubator but now a medium-sized consulting company specialising in agile scaling of enterprise solutions, specifically investment banking and payments. Early clients included Revolution Money recently sold to Amex (now ?Serve.com?) and Verifi. More recently Incept5 has been working on a number of exciting projects from Skatteetaen (the Norwegian Tax office) to Visa Inc. in San Francisco. In 2010 Incept5 broke off a division into mobile iPhone and iPad apps, achieving first place in both categories and has now spun off ?i9? providing iPad solutions in the insurance industry. In April 2011 after working for some time with Progress, Incept5 reacquired C24 together with the blue-chip client base. C24 Integration Objects is now closely tied into Spring Integration as an enterprise integration solution. Between running a consultancy and two product companies John enjoys photography and travelling with his wife and 3 young boys.

learn how to get benefits far beyond simple regression testing from your tests
Most of the discussion on automated acceptance tests focuses on immediate benefits in development and defect detection or regression testing. But that's not nearly all you can get from your tests. While working on his new book, Gojko interviewed more than 50 teams that got big pay-offs from automated acceptance tests, including some that have been using agile acceptance testing for six or seven years. In the long term, most of these teams got quite unexpected benefits, such as being able to support their system easier, significantly change their business models or survive the absence of key business people. Gojko will talk about these long term benefits of acceptance tests and what you need to do to get them.

The major trends in computing and how Java is evolving with them. Or not !
In the context of a number of high profile additions to the choices of programming language in the developers arsenal, some recent surveys have seen the Java language's lead over other languages erode in recent years. In addition, the days of the rapid buildout of the platform APIs is over. How will Java avoid the fate of becoming the Cobol of the 20-teens ? What trends in hardware and systems technology is being factored into the ongoing evolution of the Java platform to stave off its untimely death ? What are the key technologies that are going to keep Java at the top of the heap for the next 25 years ? In this session, we will take a look at the major trends in application and systems development, such as multiple languages, parallel programming, application frameworks, and see successfully Java is staying ahead of the curve.

If you're like most projects these days, you probably use Spring, Guice or another dependency framework. But how many dependencies do you really have? By exploiting the fact that you probably only have a very few number of real dependencies in your project, you can greatly simplify your application.

He’s interested in fostering a culture of improve in the software development community and organizes the popular Oslo XP meetup as well as the yearly Smidig conferences in Oslo. He is opinionated and occasionally annoying. He has been architect at some of the first projects in Norway to adopt Spring and is now architect at some of the first projects to reject Spring.

Spring's been the leader in the enterprise Java technology space for years, but relatively little is known about the deep, powerful features in the core framework that go beyond the normal scenarios. Increasingly, people consume Spring through the frameworks that build on top of it - including Spring MVC, Roo, and Integration. This power and flexibility is not reserved just for other Spring frameworks, however. In this talk, we'll explore some of the more powerful, but less well-known, techniques in the core Spring framework.
The Spring framework has served people well for years, but few have exploited the incredible power of the framework's core IoC support and component model, including the Java-only configuration model, the annotation support, the native support for JSR's 250 and 330, and the incredible AOP and meta-framework support that the other Spring frameworks - Spring Batch, MVC, Integration - etc., all exploit. This talk introduces viewers to the powerful technologies including in the core Spring framework that can be used to meet any challenge - from component-level use cases to low-level framework-building scenarios.

Arquillian is the in-container test framework led by JBoss that is redefining the testing landscape in Java EE. It not only simplifies the task of writing tests, but it provides a tool for exploring the behavior of the Java EE programming models and deployment mechanisms. In some cases you'll use test cases to ensure proper interaction between client and server, others to verify portable behavior across compliant containers and countless more to assert the features of various technologies. We'll spend only a brief amount of time on theory and goals of Arquillian. Then we'll showcase recent additions to Arquillian's capabilities, inviting you to think of ways Arquillian can be useful to your application's test suite or your personal discovery process.
In this session, we'll address the missing link in Enterprise Java development: simple, easy integration testing. Unit tests and mock objects will only take you so far; the only answer which truly ensures that all components are playing nicely is a comprehensive integration suite. Unfortunately, writing integration tests has historically involved manual setup of a heavy, cumbersome test harness. That's time lost, but it doesn't have to be anymore. Here we'll introduce Arquillian, a powerful container-oriented testing framework layered atop TestNG and JUnit. Arquillian manages your runtime, abstracting out deployment and allowing you to focus on real test logic. We'll cover: * Transparent container lifecycle management * Declarative deployments * Test Enrichment (Dependency injection intotests) * In-container test execution Attend this talk to learn how the simplified component model of Java EE can be applied to testable development.

Do you think event handling is boring and that asynchronous programming can be error-prone? Reactive programming is here to help.
As programming is more and more based on events and asynchronous calls, the limitations of the observer pattern are becoming obvious. Reactive programming solves this by operating on streams of events rather than the events themselves. Frameworks for reactive programming in functional programming languages have existed for some time, but Reactive Extensions (Rx) from Microsoft marks a breakthrough for this paradigm in imperative languages. Reactive programming has also become popular in Scala. This is a practical introduction to reactive programming. Currently, this paradigm is less convenient in Java than in Scala or C#, but when Java gets lambda expressions (closures) this will improve a lot...

New Java developers consider providing an implementation of the "equals" method for a given class to be nothing but trivial... until eventually they read "Effective Java" and realize for non-trivial cases of classes with multiple inheritance it is considered impossible. Complexity abounds in all that we do in software development... choosing a language, choosing a framework, developing the architecture of the system. For most development shows this topic of complexity is never even discussed... resulting in accidental complexity. For a software project to survive long term, fighting complexity is a constant battle. Complexity must be understood and carefully designed.
Of all the non-functional requirements of software development, complexity receives the least attention and seems to be the most important from a long term standard point. This talk will look at some of forces that drive complexity at the code level and at a system level and their impact. We will discuss what causes us to over look complexity, how our perception of it changes over time and what we can do about it?

This presentation covers three case studies where traditional RDBMS approaches had been taken, and ultimately abandoned in favor of NoSQL document databases and massive, fast-access storage mechanisms. The presentation covers Java, mongoDB, HBase, GridFS, and HDFS, and provides insights into how each of of the applications were designed, deployed, refactored, and launched in production.
Not-only-SQL systems can be applied in a large number of problem domains. In general, it's safe to say that NoSQL is a contender against traditional RDBMSs if data storage and retrieval needs aren't transactional.

Learn how to seduce your colleagues over to the Git side by offering them a Subversion-friendly, backward-compatible infrastructure. No slides, only hard-core command line action! We'll go through the basics of git-svn, through centralized Git-SVN mirror, to the final migration away from SVN.
Our company Subversion repository recently rounded 100.000 revisions. Our main product now counts over 50.000 files, in a workspace of several gigabytes. The pains of tending to a project of this size is made worse by Subversion. Updates and commits take a long while, working with branches is unbearable, and the workspace itself is immensely slowed down by the thousands of miniscule .svn folders powdered around in each directory. At the same time, we haven't been able to make the switch to Git, for the same reason as many others: Lack of tooling, Windows-friendliness, learning curve - these are all excuses that can and will be overcome, some day. But for now, we had to come up with something different.. We decided that those of us who want to make the switch to distributed SCM should not have to wait for it. For over a year, more and more of the development team have joined in on doing SCM via our Git-SVN mirror. Setting up this kind of infrastructure is not trivial, but in this talk I’ll guide you through all the steps, as well as a few more you should make when you finally want to leave SVN behind. This talk is slide free! Be prepared for a lot of command-line action!

Discussion about the SQL and non-SQL debate, unveiling facts and speculation.
The “no-SQL” movement seems to be growing in popularity worldwide; especially as cloud computing is becoming more widespread. It seems that many developers believe we are facing a paradigm change in respect to how we store the information from our applications. But it is quite clear that the opportunities and consequences are not quite clear for everyone as this topic is becoming more hyped up. So what is the deal about “no-SQL”? First of all, we need to understand what a database is, and what kind of services the database provides us with. Also we need to apply lessons from history to many of the claims regarding non-SQL databases such as; you don’t need a schema when you’re not using SQL. But is this true? In this short presentation we will analyze what a database actually is and put this up towards various claims, facts and speculation surrounding the SQL/no-SQL debate

Learn why Apache Camel can make integration much easier using EIP patterns in its intuitive DSL allowing you to build integration flows in "lego style". See how flexible Camel is, allowing you to embed and run Camel in many containers ranging from standalone, web apps such as Tomcat, JEE such as JBoss, and OSGi containers. Hear about the importance of a thriving community and hear about other popular Open Source projects using Camel out of the box. See live code and examples and how you can quickly get up and running Apache Camel using Maven or Eclipse tooling.
Apache Camel, a very popular integration framework, builds on the principles of the EIPs (Enterprise Integration Patterns) and DSLs (Domain Specific Language). In this talk we show how integration can become much easier and accessible with Apache Camel. By wiring together EIP patterns, processes and transports, integrating becomes as simple as building routes "lego style.", The wiring is done using the Camel DSL. This talk includes live demos that show how to get started with Camel and build integration flows in the four DSLs: plain Java, XML, Groovy and Scala. We will also show you how you can use Eclipse tooling to build routes using a graphical drag'n'drop environment. This talk also describes the options available for running Camel, such as embedding Camel into an existing environment. As well as running Camel with OSGi. After this we shift focus to cover the Camel community showing the rising popularity of Apache Camel. As well as briefly touching other open source projects which leverage Apache Camel in any way.

• defining architecture ‘properly’: even the ‘standards’ are ‘wrong’ • what is ‘bad’ architecture • real architecture responsibilities – who does what to whom • the technical disciplines we need; quantification, estimation measurement – of multiple qualities and costs • architectural decomposition: a value basis • software design, the same process, a different level • the role of iterative feedback in verifying architecture • The Architecture Manifesto: (advice for the revolution
What should software architecture be? How is it related to major critical software qualities and performance, to costs and constraints? How do we decide exactly what to propose, and how do we estimate and prove it is justified. How can an organization qualify their own architects, and know the difference between the frauds and the experts? Would ‘real’ architects recognize what software architects know and do? We believe that most activity, going under the name architecture, is NOT – ‘fail’. Current ‘Software achitecture’ is no more real ‘architecture’ than ‘hackers’ are ‘software engineers’. If we are just informally throwing out nice ideas, let us call ourselves ‘Software Brainstormers’. But if we are dealing with large scale, serious, and critical systems, then we need to stop using cabin-building methods and start using skyscraper designing methods – we need a serious architecture and engineering approach.

Find out how Spring Framework is evolving to support 'NoSQL' databases (such as Redis, Riak, Mongo or Neo4j) by bringing traditional Spring values such as portability, productivity and a unified POJO based programming model to this style of data access.
The needs of many enterprises have stretched traditional RDBMS based solutions to the breaking point and as a result, a plethora of new non-relational storage options have appeared: key-value stores, column storages, document and graph databases. This talk will show how the Spring Framework is evolving to support 'NoSQL' databases by bringing traditional Spring values such as portability, productivity and a unified POJO based programming model to this style of data access. During the presentation, the main features of Spring Data will be discussed by taking a tour of the various offerings out there such as Redis, Mongo and Neo4J just to name a few. Basic NoSQL knowledge is required.

For the last few years, the web has been all a-twitter about web 2.0 (and even the occasional reference to web 3.0.) Yes, the days of static web applications are officially over and while libraries like jQuery and Prototype make it easier to build modern applications, ultimately they are papering over issues in the web standards (and the browsers that implement them.) Today we're building to standards that are from the paleolithic era of web design but that's changing - and HTML 5 is a large part of that. In this talk, we'll discus just what HTML 5 is and why it matters. We'll show how you can build to HTML 5 today and which browsers support what. Thankfully, after many years of stagnation, the future of web applications looks bright!

For any code base there comes a time when you want to change it. But if you just steam ahead making changes that break the code and then fixing errors, a common situation is that every fix or change creates several more errors. It feels as if you have picked a fight with the Software Hydra - for every scary head you cut off, two more grows out! Instead, come learn The Mikado Method (http://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/book), a systematic approach to beat the Hydra and change the code in a safe way.

Distributed Computing, Architecture, design, Cloud Computing, resilient systems
In 1994 Peter Deutsch (Sun Microsystems) published the first 7 Fallacies of Distributed Computing. In 2009 Tim Bray published a discussion about how these fallacies apply to the Web. In this talk, I'll attempt to continue this discussion in terms of Cloud Computing, recently made relevant by the long Amazon AWS failure. The talk will also provide example Cloud architectures (exemplified by a set of AWS services) to discuss the different fallacies so the audience will know how to build resilient systems.

Explore the Dependency Injection approaches available to Scala developers, and introduce a new open-source dependency injection Scala library with code examples and recipes.
This session will explore the dependency injection options available to developers using Scala. It will cover several options including Java frameworks like Spring and Guice, and Scala language approaches such as the Cake pattern. Along the way, the pros and cons of each option will be discussed, for example Guice provides a nice binding DSL, but also relies on annotations and factories, leaving a non-Scala taste in your mouth when using it. Meanwhile the Cake pattern is all Scala, but self types can be confusing for people new to Scala, as can any kind of guidance for binding injections to variables. The culmination of the talk will focus on a new open source library for dependency injection which has been developed for Scala in a real world application setting, based on picking the best of the Java and Scala approaches. The talk will be technical in nature, with plenty of code examples and a cookbook of recipes for different dependency injection usages.

Covers the benefits and drawbacks of NoSQL database Compares and contrasts popular NoSQL databases – Redis, MongoDB, and Cassandra. Describes how the Spring Data project simplifies the development of Java applications that use NoSQL databases.
Relational databases have long been considered the one true way to persist enterprise data. But today, NoSQL databases are emerging as a viable alternative for many applications. They can simplify the persistence of complex data models and offer significantly better scalability, and performance. But using NoSQL databases is very different than the ACID/SQL/JDBC/JPA world that we have become accustomed to. They have different and unfamiliar APIs and a very different and usually limited transaction model. In this presentation, we describe some popular NoSQL databases – Redis, MongoDB, and Cassandra. We will compare and contrast each database’s data model and Java API using NoSQL versions of a use case from the book POJOs in Action. We describe the benefits and drawbacks with using NoSQL databases. Finally, you will learn how the Spring Data project simplifies the development of Java applications that use NoSQL databases.

Learn when to use the new fork-join framework in Java SE 7 (and when not to).
The reality of today's chip architectures s that rather than seeing ever increasing clock speeds we now see ever increasing core counts. This has a significant impact on how we write efficient code since we now need to design for parallel operations to get the best from our hardware. Concurrent programming is hard to get right, especially when faced with early Java support in the form of the sleep, interrupt, wait and notify methods along with synchronised blocks and methods with a single monitor per object. Java SE 5 started the process of enhancing Java's support for parallel programming with the concurrency APIs. Java SE 7 includes the latest revisions to this in the form of the fork-join framework (also known as JSR-166y). This session will look at how the fork-join framework can greatly simplify the code required to process a set of tasks that can be distributed among a number of parallel processing units. We'll look at some good examples for effective use of the framework as well as one that is not suited and provide some hints on what to do in this case.

Akka is a unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT (utilizing the grid/cloud). With Akka 2 this will be taken to a whole new level with its “Distributed by Design”
We believe that one should never have to choose between productivity and scalability, which has been the case with traditional approaches to concurrency and distribution. The cause of that has been the wrong tools and the wrong layer of abstraction and Akka is here to change that. Akka is a unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT (utilizing the grid/cloud). With Akka 2 this will be taken to a whole new level with its “Distributed by Design”. Akka 2 provides location transparency by abstracting away both these tangents of scalability by turning them into an operations and configuration task. This gives the Akka runtime freedom to do adaptive automatic load-balancing, cluster rebalancing, replication and partitioning. Akka is available at http://akka.io (under Apache 2 license).

You don't have to choose between fast and realistic tests. Using JUnit @RunsWith test runners, I'll show you how to write a test will run fast enough to run all the time and that also can verify integration with external systems.
Define unit test: "A test that runs fast and can run in parallel with other tests", Define integration test: "A test that uses realistic third party software or systems" Using JUnit 4.8 @RunsWith test runners, on my recent projects I've created tests that can be configured to run both with in-process fakes and with real third party systems. I've used this on large scale for tests that integrate with a database and have toyed with using the idea for slow and fast-running web integration tests. By using this approach, I have tests that are fast enough to run with Infinitest and that can also verify integration with external systems.

In this session, we'll explore the concepts of BDD and ATDD together to drive agile development using a powerful trio of testing frameworks: Arquillian Drone, WebDriver and Thucydides. Rather than just test cases, you'll build higher-level, end-to-end functional behavior using reusable web test components and following a clear "given, when, then" perspective. The result: cleaner, clearer tests that both validate your requirements and document your system behavior.
Unit tests are programmer's best friend, but relying on them exclusively gives an illusion of overall system integrity. At some level, we need to verify how our components integrate and ensure unexpected behavior does not creep in when we shift the application into the target runtime. It all amounts to whether your application is providing the end user what he or she is really needs (tire swing) instead of what anyone thinks they need. How can we save our users from frustration, keep the fail whale at bay and communicate with stakeholders that the requirements are being met? We'll show you how the Arquillian testing platform can give you these guarantees by driving agile development. We'll explore the concepts of BDD and ATDD together using a powerful trio of testing frameworks: Arquillian, WebDriver and Thucydides. Rather than just test cases, you'll build higher-level, end-to-end functional behavior using reusable web test components and following a clear "given, when, then" perspective. The result: cleaner, clearer tests that both validate your requirements and document your system behavior. Testing behaviors has never been so easy, and so real! If you care about quality of your software you definitely shouldn't miss this talk!

From code review to continuous inspection with Sonar
The Job of a developer has evolved strongly in the last 10 years, pushed by new requirements and new tools such as Continuous Integration, Test Driven Development and refactoring. Software Development Industry has now reached a sufficient level of maturity to engage into new practices such as managing source code quality while developing applications. After introducing the concept of the internal quality (and non-quality), this presentation will show why and how to measure this quality in order to define action plans. We will then see how to use Sonar to support such practice in a classical approach code, audit oriented. Thereafter, we will see why and how to go further by using the powerful differential views in Sonar to support a new practice : the Continuous Inspection. This is a important transformation of this practice from a control oriented process to a development support oriented process

Learn about common serialization pitfalls and techniques for their solution, and get tips on optimizing the efficiency of serialized data.
Java serialization is a powerful core technology used by many applications and as an underpinning for many sophisticated Java technologies such as RMI, EJB, SDO, JPA, and distributed caching. Yet its implications for the design of Java systems are often overlooked. This presentation explains the continuing relevance of Java serialization. Whether for designing a system specifically concerned with serialization, developing reusable components, or updating code in which serializable objects exist, a good understanding of serialization considerations is invaluable. Learn about common serialization pitfalls and techniques for their solution, and get tips on optimizing the efficiency of serialized data.

Embrace our UNIX heritage while staying within Java. Learn the techniques and tools to better embrace UNIX within Java -- native executables and man pages, proper daemonization, using native libraries easily, building great command line interfaces, and tools and techniques that let you embrace UNIX idioms.
Embrace our UNIX heritage while staying within Java. Learn the techniques and tools to better embrace UNIX within Java -- from native executables and man pages, proper daemonization without wrapper tooling, using native libraries more easily, building great command line interfaces, to the tools and techniques that let you embrace UNIX idioms -- this talk reaches out to the sysop in each of us. Over the last several years, the Java community has started to better embrace the environment in which it typically runs. It turns out that in many cases working with native tooling and libraries simply works better, and we've developed great ways to make it painless and straightforward. Working with UNIX goes both ways, though. As we embrace the UNIX way of using tools, we find it behooves us to also build our tools so that they play nicely from UNIX as well as using it. We can easily, and without breaking any of the Java rules, work with native package managers, create native executables from our jars, and work well within a multi-process world. It turns out that our practices in the Java world actually make Java tools some of the most pleasent to work with operationally, as long as we follow some basic practices.

Tired of bloated and unstructured test suites? Come see how Spock and Groovy can help you articulate concise, readable specifications for your system´s desired behavior.
Spock is an expressive and elegant testing framework for Java and Groovy applications. You use it as an alternative to JUnit to create readable and concise tests through a simple specification language. Because it is based on Groovy, it takes away unnecessary boilerplate common in Java based unit tests and leaves you with a structured specification of a program´s wanted behavior. It even comes with a built in mocking API. Spock is compatible with JUnit, which means Spock specifications runs seamlessly in IDEs, in builds tools and on continuous integration servers. This lightning talk will introduce Spock through several examples.
Odin is a IT consultant with a background in enterprise Java solutions. He has experience with using Groovy for testing Java projects and loves making things better.

Slowly we're beginning to see alternative languages (to Java) appear in the enterprise. John will be looking at some of the advantages and demonstrating how we can use parts of the language without having to dive into the deep end.
There are literally hundreds of programming languages but Java, C & C++ cover over 90% of all the code written on the servers in the investment banking world. It's true to say that there's virtually nothing you can't do in these languages but it doesn't stop enthusiastic "alternative language groupies" telling us there's a better way and that we should all change what we're doing; Ruby, Clojure, Scala, Haskell, Erlang to name just a few. There is something we can learn from these languages without having to become an expert. John will walk through some existing production architectures looking at how some of the languages have changed the way we work.

Kotlin is a modern statically typed general-purpose language designed to be safe, concise, expressive and 100% Java-compatible. It is compiled to Java byte code as well as JavaScript, so it can run on both client- and server-side. This session gives an overview of the key features of Kotlin and demonstrates how the new language integrates into the existing infrastructure. On top of that we show how one can make Java APIs better using Kotlin, without having to alter them in any way.
Kotlin is a modern statically typed general-purpose language developed by JetBrains (creators of IntelliJ IDEA) and distributed under the Apache 2 License. Kotlin is focused on being a *good tool* for a wide range of development tasks: from mobile applications to enterprise software. It compiles to Java byte code as well as JavaScript, so it can run on both client- and server-side. We prefer pragmatic design to scientific novelty and learn from existing project all the time: both their strong and weak points. The main design principles behind Kotlin are: * 100% Java compatibility: seamlessly use Java from Kotlin and Kotlin from Java; * Fast bytecode and fast compilation; * Static type safety; * Conciseness and flexibility without too much complexity. This session gives an overview of the key features of Kotlin and demonstrates how the new language integrates into the existing infrastructure: from libraries to the IDE and build tools. On top of that, we show how one can make Java APIs better using Kotlin, without having to alter them in any way: * Kotlin’s extensions turn standard JDK collections into fluent data structures that can be processed in the spirit of LINQ; * Even Swing control layout can be turned into a nice declarative code by type-safe builders implemented in Kotlin...

Illustration of functional programming techniques based on common concepts and examples people are already familiar with: declarative approaches, logic programming, dataflow and transformation, immutability, lambdas, pattern matching, expression-based code.
From JVM to .NET languages, from minor coding idioms to system-level architectures, functional programming is enjoying a long overdue surge in interest. Functional programming is certainly not a new idea and, although not apparently as mainstream as object-oriented and procedural programming, many of its concepts are also more familiar than many programmers believe. This talk examines functional and declarative programming styles from the point of view of coding patterns, little languages and programming techniques already familiar to many programmers.

An introduction to the Rust language and RustyCage the Rust IDE plugin for Eclipse. Rust is an experimental, concurrent, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Mozilla Labs.It is designed to be practical, supporting pure-functional, concurrent-actor, imperative-procedural, and object-oriented styles.
Rust is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language. It visually resembles the C language family, but differs significantly in syntactic and semantic details. Its design is oriented toward concerns of “programming in the large”, that is, of creating and maintaining boundaries – both abstract and operational – that preserve large-system integrity, availability and concurrency. It supports a mixture of imperative procedural, concurrent actor, object-oriented and pure functional styles. Rust also supports generic programming and metaprogramming, in both static and dynamic styles. Rust is influenced by Alef, C++, Camlp4, Common Lisp, Erlang, Haskell, Hermes, Limbo, Napier, Napier88, Newsqueak, NIL, Sather, Standard ML

This talk shows how you can link data across different data sets, and find near-duplicate records, without common identifiers using well-known statistical techniques. It also presents an open source Java engine for doing this easily.
What if you have customer data from CRM and from billing, but no common customer IDs? Or your CRM contains lots of duplicate customer records? How to link the records, or identify the duplicates? Similar problems recur in many, perhaps even most, systems, from CRM, to BI, to Linked Open Data. Solving them is a substantial challenge, as data quality is generally low, with names and other data written every which way. Surprisingly, statisticians have been working with this issue since the 1940s, and have developed a rich set of techniques for handling the problem. There is a considerable body of statistical and mathematical theory in this field, but the core ideas are simple and easy to understand and apply. This talk presents the basic theory, together with a solution: an open source Java engine based on Lucene, called Duke. The use of the engine is shown with concrete examples, including how the engine was used successfully in a project for Hafslund.

Stop learning frameworks and languages, start learning programming.
At every Javazone, the rooms are filled with speakers wanting to teach you the newest framework or the hottest programming language. And it's always revolutionary, it'll always make you 10X more productive, and it's always a blast to work with. So people learn their frameworks and their languages, but they never take the time to learn basic skills like unit testing, refactoring, object-oriented design or patterns. Enough already!

You know how you always mean to apply proper MVC principles but end up with a mess of jQuery instead? No more excuses: now there's Backbone. In this presentation, you'll learn how to harness the power of Backbone by example, as we build a simple browser side application from the bottom up using nothing but Backbone and your favourite DOM toolkit.
Have you ever tried to write a moderately complex browser side application with the assumption that jQuery is probably all you need for the job? I mean, fire off some AJAX requests, then just use some DOM manipulation to put the results where you want them—how hard can it be, right? Would you have enjoyed maintaining the code that resulted from that assumption? No, neither would I. Would you like to see a better solution? As it turns out, programmers have known how to keep their frontend code under control for a while using a surprisingly simple principle called MVC. Now that the browser has suddenly become a serious platform for application development, the need for MVC (or, at least, the basic concepts behind MVC) has become so apparent that we already have multiple rival MVC libraries for the browser platform. Backbone is arguably the most popular of the lot, and certainly one of the most lightweight. In this presentation, you'll learn how to harness the power of Backbone by example, as we build a simple browser side application from the bottom up using nothing but Backbone and your favourite DOM toolkit.

The road to Continuous delivery may sound easy when reading about it. But is it? I was given the change of introducing this idee to a team that was f... up. They had the tools but did not use them right. How did we do? where are we on the path to Continuous delivery..
Everyone talks about it, everyone “knows” how to do it, but everyone has an excuse for not doing it. I entered a team where everyone was running around like headless chickens and could not do anything right. Code was hacked in production. Errors occurred, was fixed, and then unfixed by by another developer trying desperately to make things work. A depoy when I arrived took 3 days to put into production !!! just because of an minor error. I was given the task of making it right. Where to go? of course “continuous delivery”. what happened? did I make it? what was the issues on the way? how did i do it.. (doh.. did i spoil the surprise?)

This session presents a comprehensible, clearly arranged style for implementing consistent Swing application by showing detailed sources for a contact editor example.
In this session we explain how to implement consistent Swing applications in a comprehensible and clearly arranged way. We show detailed sources for a contact editor example and discuss a bunch of tips. The presented implementation style is applicable for the popular desktop patterns "Model-View-Presenter" and "Presentation Model" and variants; it can be used with or without visual editor, with different binding approaches and component creation mechanisms, as well as different layout techniques. It can be ported to other toolkits such as JavaFX, the SWT and even to other environments, e.g. the GWT.

The highs, lows and lessons of splitting the Guardian's platform from one monolithic application to many loosely coupled applications.
A few years ago the Guardian (www.guardian.co.uk) completed a major rebuild of it's systems that produced a single application that succesfully served the high volume of traffic to the site, accomplished many of the project's other goals and was judged a success. However, we weren't satisfied. Any new addition risked affecting the whole site's performance and stability, the code base was continuously growing and there was little room for innovation and experimentation. In this talk I'll discuss the various ways we've attempted to break down the site into a collection of smaller applications including the difficulties and missteps as well as the successes.
Phil is a software architect at the Guardian who has spent long enough eating his own dog food to realise that it's not always someone else's incompetence that leads to an imperfect solution. Phil firmly believes that architects should regularly get their fingers dirty in code and hacks some Scala whenever he gets the chacne.

Learn about Java agents and the power of java.lang.instrument package. Learn how to program Java in unusual way and what kind of tricks the Java tools perform with the classes in order to provide you the state of the art.
A Java agents are pluggable self contained components that run embedded in a JVM and intercept the classloading process. They were introduced in Java 5 along with the powerful java.lang.instrument package. Java agents can be loaded statically at startup or dynamically (programmatically) at runtime to attach to a running process in a fail-safe fashion. Java agents were an awesome addition to the JVM as it opened a lot of opportunities for tool designers and changed Java tooling landscape quite drastically. In conjunction with Java bytecode manipulation libraries it is now possible to do amazing things to Java classes: we can experiment with programming models, redefine classes in runtime, record execution flow, etc. In this session I’d like to give an overview of Java agents’ functionality along with the usage examples and real world experiences. You will learn, how to implement an agent and apply Instrumentation API in combination with bytecode manipulation libraries to solve interesting tasks.

Salesforce.com, the Social CRM in the cloud, only a few clicks away and no software or hardware to install! Isn’t salesforce.com just a point & click solution then? Where is the charm in that for a Java developer? Or the challenge? Well, what if your clients request advanced customizations to the standard salesforce.com installation? Who then is equipped for the task if not a skilled java developer as yourself? To solve these customization requirements salesforce.com has introduced their own development platform, force.com. Based on standard Java functionality it introduces flexibility as in any other Java project. Force.com with its flexibility have many advantages and opportunities, but I also see several challenges. Especially regarding quality ensurance of delivery and code, and obtain maintainable solutions. This talk will highlight some of the advantages and challenges implementing a salesforce.com solution, and sketch a solution for continuous integration that ensures quality of your tests, your code and your deployment routines

How Comoyo made sure that the Norwegian football league could be viewed on the Internet. Testing a heterogeneous system mostly (but not entirely) based on Amazon EC2 resources.
Comoyo provides infrastructure for moving pictures, both movies and TV, as well as live television. On March 23, 2012, the Norwegian national soccer league started up, and we were in no way certain that we would be able to handle the load we expected all the football fans in Norway to generate. The movie delivery subsystem is mostly, but not entirely, consisting of components hosted in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and mostly (but not entirely) written in Java. In this talk we describe how we used multiple tools to generate what we believed to be realistic loads against our systems, and how we used this to tune the system to actually perform. This may seem like a simple task, but it wasn't: * The system is made of components, but the component developers were not aware of the full system architecture. * Some components thought to "just work" (such as load balancers) were discovered to be a bottleneck. Initially, we didn't even think about load balancers, since they were effectively invisible for the developers. * Writing test scripts for load testing is a skill separate from writing other types of tests, and the test tools themselves are much less well standardized or developed and much easier to use for some tasks than others. The interplay between performance monitoring tools and test tools is less than perfect, but fusing data between the two is necessary to interpret test results. * We did all of this, we learned how to harness the tools, we delivered the Tippeliga, and we did it all in just a few weeks. In this talk we share some of the hard won lessons on how to write tests, interpret their results, and how to actually tune a system for high performance.

Learn about G1, the next big thing in garbage collection, about the inner workings of a modern JVM and how you can tune your JVM for optimal GC performance. See what problems Mark-And-Sweeps solves, what limits there are, and where G1 takes over when Java system goes from large to huge.
With Java systems getting larger and larger, using more and more heap, just raising the max heap size will no longer save you from long GC pauses. Concurrent Mark-And-Sweep has been the solution for a long time, but as heaps grows beyond a couple of giga bytes in size, Mark-And-Sweep GC pauses will grow beyond levels acceptable in modern Java systems. This presentation takes us through the inner workings of a modern JVM and how you can tune your JVM for optimal GC performance. The problems we're facing with ever growing heap sizes will be explained, together with how Mark And Sweep garbage collector does garbage collection today, what limits there are, and how the G1 (Garbage First) garbage collector will take over tomorrow, when Java heaps goes from large to huge.

The talk will get you into the existing spring-based ecommerce middleware setup of the Otto Group, describe the aspects that led to the refactoring project and present the approach followed to identify and prioritize requirements. You will get an understanding on how the project operated in a very unique context of various companies
In 2010 the world’s 2nd largest web retailer (b2c) – the Hamburg-based Otto Group – decided to refactor large parts of its existing multi-tenancy middleware and backend landscape from a classical 3-tier layout towards a service oriented architecture. The aim of this project is to support the upcoming challenges imposed by the global growth strategy which includes the promising BRIC nations. The latter will cause a significant increase of traffic driven to the 50+ web shops operated by the Otto Group companies. Additionally the new platform will support the companies in utilizing the large amount of data (traffic, user tracking, orders …) being collected during runtime much better than today. The talk will get you into the existing Spring 2.x-based setup, describe the aspects that led to the refactoring project and present the approach followed to identify and prioritize requirements. You will get an understanding on how the project operated in a very unique context of various companies having different requirements with respect to their business goals. Finally you will be presented the high-level architecture and how it is supposed to support the future ecommerce strategy of the Otto Group using technologies like JEE 6, Glassfish v3.x, ESB, messaging, CRM/ERP integration and caches.

Learn how Comoyo use MongoDB on Amazon EC2 to build a solution for storing large data with high availability and scalability, without sacrificing reliability.
Many developers are discovering that traditional relational databases make it hard to scale to the large data volumes and user traffic required by Internet-scale applications. MongoDB is sailing up as one of the leading contenders in the NoSQL space. We at Comoyo are using MongoDB on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) for our payment subsystems, with a target of some hundred millions users regularly accessing the system. As we are handling financial transactions with high demands on reliability, we needed to make sure that MongoDB did not sacrifice our customers' safety on the altar of performance. This talk presents how we use MongoDB to gain higher availability and scalability than traditional databases, with simpler development and administration, without losing the required reliability and durability. The talk describes how we configured replication, and our approach to work around the lack of transactions in MongoDB. There will be pointers on tuning MongoDB for availability and reliability. Also, the talk will describe how we used MongoDB to implement once-and-only-once messaging semantics on top of Amazon Simple Queuing Service (SQS).

Neo4j is the world’s leading graph database. Its expressive data model makes it ideal for managing complex, densely connected data. In this session you’ll learn how to use Noe4j to create and query data belonging to the complex history of Doctor Who, the world’s oldest sci-fi tv show.
Doctor Who is the world’s longest running science-fiction TV series. Battling daleks, cybermen and sontarans, and always accompanied by his trusted human companions, the last Timelord has saved earth from destruction more times than you’ve failed the build. Neo4j is the world’s leading open source graph database. Designed to interrogate densely connected data with lightning speed, it lets you traverse millions of nodes in a fraction of the time it takes to run a multi-join SQL query. When these two meet, the result is an entertaining introduction to the complex history of a complex hero, and a rapid survey of the elegant APIs of a delightfully simple graph database. Armed only with a data store packed full of geeky Doctor Who facts, by the end of this session we’ll have you tracking down pieces of memorabilia from a show that, like the graph theory behind Neo4j, is older than Codd's relational model.

Ever seen technical drawings you just couldn't make any sense of, even though you know very well what they were supposed to show? Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes a thousand words can't repair the damage done by a bad drawing.
Ever seen technical drawings you just couldn't make any sense of, even though you know very well what they were supposed to show? Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes a thousand words can't repair the damage done by a bad drawing. Why do some drawings communicate directly and simply while others just look like a thrown-together set of boxes and lines? Perhaps the first rule in improving technical drawings is to care. Next, consider the message, purpose and audience for a picture. Next, which details make a drawing convincing and which stand in the way of reading? Whether it's a nice font, balanced colours or straight lines, these details make a difference. And finally, practice. Practice a lot. It is difficult to produce a perfect drawing, whether drawn freehand or with a tool, but there is always scope for better.

Overview of the rising web APIs world, a disruption as important as open source for Web developers. Lastest version 2.1 of the open source Restlet Framework will be presented, as well as APISpark an innovative PaaS for RESTful web APIs based on Restlet.
The impressive rise of open web APIs disrupts the way we develop on the Web, in a way probably as important as open source. We will explain what is a web API, walk through the most striking ones listed below, explain their key success factors and present the main solutions to create, host and manage them: - Twitter Streaming API with its OAuth autentication and mandatory usage of SSL - CouchDB for its live JSON based notification API - Twilio API for its business model, its ability to control real-world telecom services and its comprehensive and versionned documentation - Google Maps Image APIs for support of non XML/JSON representations - Amazon DynamoDB API for an example of non-RESTful web API but pragmatic and nonetheless useful, an will think about a RESTful rewrite We will also explain in more detail how to develop a RESTful web API in Java thanks to Reslet Framework, the first open source project to offer a REST toolkit in 2005, that releases its 2.1 version along with the "Restlet in Action" book published by Manning. In the end, we will introduce APISpark, an innovative all-in-one cloud platform (PaaS) for web APIs, based on Restlet Framework that lets you create and host RESTful web APIs in just a couple of minutes.

We present empirical results that show how relative estimation may result in biased assessments of similarity and over-optimistic effort estimates. We observe that tasks tend to be assessed as more similar than they are in reality when compared with each other, that the similarity of two tasks depends on the direction of the comparison and that it matters whether the comparison is based on difference in work-hours or as the ratio. We use these observations and other evidence to suggest ways of improving the accuracy of relative estimation as it is done in, for example, agile projects.
Most human judgment includes comparisons of a target object with one or more reference objects. Comparisons are known to sometimes lead to judgment biases. We perceive the moon as larger the closer it gets to the horizon. We feel water at room temperature is warmer if our hand was submerged in cold water just before. We estimate things are smaller than they really are when we compare them with smaller objects and larger than they really are when we compare them with larger objects. Software development effort estimation is also frequently based on comparing the effort of one task relative to that of another. We present empirical results that show how relative estimation may result in biased assessments of similarity and over-optimistic effort estimates. We observe that tasks tend to be assessed as more similar than they are in reality when compared with each other, that the similarity of two tasks depends on the direction of the comparison and that it matters whether the comparison is based on difference in work-hours or as the ratio. We also observe that the use of the Fibonacci-scale for agile estimation sometimes has unwanted side-effects which may lead to under-estimation of tasks. We use these observations and other evidence to suggest ways of improving the accuracy of relative estimation as it is done in, for example, agile projects.

Traditional relation databases may work fine for small data sets. With larger data sets, performance may become an issue. For a telecom company such as Telenor, the issue became a real problem. This is the story about how usage of denormalized indexed data and a graph database solved the problem for Telenor.
Telenor calculated in 2010 that it´s self-service web solution for businesses & enterprises, MinBedrift, would not scale with the projected customer growth beyond 2012. In order to achieve acceptable user response times, the current solution was dependent of nightly pre-caching the customers’ data. However, the time available for caching was closing fast, and then response times would become increasingly longer. In the end Telenor would start losing customers. This is the story about how usage of NoSQL solutions such as Lucene/Solr index & Neo4j graph database solved the problem, and then some more.
Katrina is the system architect of Telenor Norway’s self service web solutions for the business segment. She has during the last year been involved in scalability and performance improvements related to customers being exposed to large data sets.
Currently working at Telenor Norway as a system area architect, Sebastian is responsible for business services in the mobile value chain. The last year he has been working on a project looking into how such services better can support search and retrieval of large dynamic data sets by the clients.

Gain a deep understanding of how hardware caches work, how to write programs to best use them, what the future holds and how that will change the way we write programs.
Caches are used in many layers of applications that we develop today, holding data inside or outside of your runtime environment, or even distributed across multiple platforms in data fabrics. However, considerable performance gains can often be realized by configuring the deployment platform/environment and coding your application to take advantage of the properties of CPU caches. In this talk, we will explore what CPU caches are, how they work and how to measure your JVM-based application data usage to utilize them for maximum efficiency. We will discuss the future of CPU caches in a many-core world, as well as advancements that will soon arrive such as HP's Memristor.

FedEx packages go through a tracked, automated process that has proven highly successful - but what about software? We’ll analyze continuous delivery practices that are fully-automated & transparent, and we'll show how to “fedex” your commits to production on application servers like JBoss, Tomcat, Weblogic and others using Jenkins and LiveRebel.
When you send a package through FedEx it goes through a tracked, automated process that makes sure that the package arrives promptly at the destination. The same should apply to every commit that you check into the trunk. Continuous delivery describes how this process can be made fully automated and transparent and we will show you how your commits can be “fedexed” to production on application servers like JBoss, Tomcat, Weblogic and others with the help from Jenkins and LiveRebel. The main idea of continuous delivery is the deployment pipeline. Every commit that enters the pipeline should go through automated integration and testing and if successful, produce a release candidate. We will show how Jenkins can be used to orchestrate the process all the way to the staging environment. Once we're there, the most complicated phase begins. The release candidate needs to be deployed to production, without disrupting the users or introducing risks. LiveRebel makes production updates quick, automated, non-disruptive and reversible. It finishes the job and delivers the updated version right into the users hands. In this talk we will build a full clustered environment and a deployment pipeline so that commits into the trunk would update a live chat server while you keep on chatting.

The power of objects is greatly underestimated. Isolated objects aren’t interesting. Class-based programs limit us to reason about isolated objects. The essence of object orientation is that objects interact to achieve a common goal. The talk extends traditional OO to give the programmer mastery of multi-object interaction.
Nygaard and Dahl invented Simula’s classes and objects to master complex problems. Alan Kay coined the term ‘object orientation’ with its networks of communicating objects to facilitate simple and powerful mental models. His goal was to make computers and programming comprehensible to everybody. Mainstream programmers missed the importance of communication in Kay’s OO and misused the term. Their much weaker approach is better called ‘class orientation’. I have extended Kay’s original OO with explicit concepts and code that specify how objects interact at runtime. With the DCI (Data-Context-Interaction) paradigm, programmers can reason about their code, new team members get quickly up to speed, maintainers lead a better and more productive life. The DCI Context is a new abstraction that supplements the commen class. While a class says everything about the inside of an object and nothing about the objects surrounding it, a DCI Context says everything about a network of communicating objects and nothing about their insides. The class is great for describing autonomous objects such as the domain objects in the Data part of DCI. The DCI Context is great for describing how use cases are realized by networks of communicating objects. Communication is now a first-class citizen of programming!

Introducing NoSQL and Cassandra and using it to implement a set of Big Data use cases for enterprise applications.
Big Data is a fast growing trend in enterprise applications that comes with a novel promise compare to past technological revolutions: being able to retrieve and manipulate as much data as necessary to bring up new use cases or to improve the user experience. This is made possible thanks to a set of new technologies and databases that are designed to handle any scale. This presentation will use one of them, Cassandra, to implement several use cases that follow the big data approach described previously: real-time analytic, storing a click stream or a news feed, and more...

I'll give an introduction and high-level semantics of C# 5.0's new support for asynchronous programming, asynchronous methods with embedded await expressions.
This talk will present the new language support for asynchronous programming available in the upcoming version of C#, C# 5.0. Writing distributed or even just IO-intensive applications that are responsive yet frugal with resources is a difficult task. With the rise of web programming this has become a common problem. The solution lies in adopting asynchronous operations that separate issuing a request from awaiting its completion. While it has always been possible to program asynchronously in C# it has never been easy. The challenge is that asynchronous operations rely on callbacks, forcing the programmer to cede control. This inversion of control-flow impedes the use of structured control constructs, the staple of sequential code. The new asynchronous methods available in C# 5.0 enable straigthforward asynchronous and concurrent programming using structured control constructs. I'll start with an informal introduction to the basic feature, its inherent support for concurrency, and its built-in extension points. If time permits, I'll sketch a high-level operational semantics designed to explain the feature without resorting to sample compiler output, the lower-level description contained in Microsoft's draft specification.

While memory management is free in Java, some ways are still better than others of how to make use of it... and to measure how much your object actually do use!
RAM prices have plummeted and servers with tens or even hundreds of Gigabytes of memory have become common these days. What this means to your application's architecture and deployment topology is important. On heap caching of data within enterprise application is a common example. Yet how do you make the best use of all that memory ? Since version 2.5, Ehcache comes with the ability to size your caches in bytes rather that in entry counts. Nothing really fancy, if it wasn't for Java's lack of sizeOf function. This presentation will take you, with code, through the journey of implementing the sizeOf library for the Java platform; across multiple versions, vendors and all their permutations (including 32 vs. 64 bit platforms, CMS, Compressed OOPS, ...). The library also led us to offer new & much more dynamic ways of making use of that memory for on-heap caches within your application...

In the words of John Gage, "The network is the computer". At the heart of everything we do is a complex system of infrastructure from which we are often abstracted. For general application development this abstraction provides the convenience of simplifying our efforts. With a growing number of mobil applications with intermittent connectivity and higher latency, and with increased hostility on the network from a security standpoint, there is great value in pulling back the curtain and understanding the details of this computer. This session will start with the underlying understanding of networking at a low level. At this level we will discuss, IP, MAC, ARP, DNS and DHCP. As we walk up an abstraction level, we discuss sockets, NAT, gateways and firewalls along with the use of TCP and UDP. Spending some time at this layer can make network developers more productive, as we look at tools which help us answer the question, "who owns this port?", "where is this packet going?" and "What is my latency and why?". The session will end with a little fun looking at wifi, where will we sniff, snort, crack:) From a security stand point we will look at the challenges of wifi and how it has become the weakest component on the net. This session is extremely fast-pace. The attendees will come away with a more enhanced understanding of the this thing we call the internet. It will include through discussion or demonstration tools such as tcproute, tcpdump, nemesis, nmap, tcpmon and wireshark.

The Agile Manifesto Principles need updating, badly! They are code focussed, and are not explicit enough about delivering real stakeholder value to all critical stakeholders! We suggest 10 entirely new agile principles.
The Agile Manifesto has its heart in the right place, We are only worried about its ‘mind’. And its first principle “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software”, is central to the ideas in this paper. Our problem with agile is not in its ideals, but in the everyday teaching and practices we see. What has happened, is the same problem afflicting all software and IT projects, long before agile appeared. Our technocratic culture has forgotten our stakeholders and their values. The practices are far too ‘programmer centric’, and far too little ‘stakeholder value’ centric. The result is that ‘working software’ is delivered to a ‘customer’. But, necessary values are not necessarily, and all too rarely, delivered to all critical stakeholders. Code has no value in itself. We can deliver bug free code, that has little or none of the anticipated value. We can deliver software function, as defined in requirements, to the ‘customer’ – but totally fail to deliver critical value to many critical stakeholders. We fear this paper may not correct the narrow-mindedness of the coder community, and our principles do apply to a higher level of thinking than coding; but we are going to try to formulate a much clearer set of principles, a more explicit set; and in the subsequent paper, clearer ‘values’ than the Agilistas managed to do. We have one decided advantage – We are not subject to lowest common denominator politics – as they were – We can express our own opinion – unopposed!

Come join a fun talk as we explore the best and worst of web APIs. We'll see what makes an API great - and what makes it awful. From data formats to documentation to authentication - there's a lot to learn whether you're building the next Facebook API or you're building a small on-premise application.
APIs have seen dramatic growth in the last few years, and they're now powering everything we do. This is causing a fundamental shift in how we write applications - it's not just a UI and a database anymore. This makes good APIs even more important than ever. Come join a fun talk as we explore the best and worst of web APIs. We'll see what makes an API great - and what makes it awful.

How do patterns in literature, music, and architecture inform our perspective on the code we write and the systems we build? A timeless quote from Winston Churchill and a brief exploration of the humanities can provide a fresh perspective on the technology debates about languages, platforms, frameworks, databases, and more.
Winston Churchill famously said, "First we shape our buildings, and afterwards, our buildings shape us." He was talking about the reconstruction of the House of Parliament, which was damaged in a bombing raid in World War II. There was a debate about how to shape the chamber to best accommodate the deliberative activity of the body that met in it. Churchill was talking about buildings, but it turns out his insight is a very general one indeed. Developers are constantly debating their choices of language, platform, editor, methodology, and even where to put the curly braces. The robust internal dialog in our community is a healthy thing, but our debates are often focused on the wrong topics. Have you ever compared languages by performance benchmarks? Platforms by alleged claims of developer productivity? Methodologies by feature velocity? Then there is a very good chance you're doing it wrong. Rather than focus on the material content of our debates—language performance, editor productivity, methodological velocity—we should take Churchill's advice and think about the form of our choices. How will our choice of language influence the way we solve future problems? What assumptions does our methodology make about the nature of work? How will our choice of database affect the kinds of problems we think of as solvable? Drawing on lessons from building architecture, literature, music, the visual arts, and even software itself, we'll learn the priority of interpreting the form of things before attempting to understand their content. You'll come away with powerful new intellectual tools to help you navigate the perennial debates that technology leaders engage over and over—and you may never look at software architecture the same way again.

Cloudname is a system for coordinating distributed services. It provides a system for assigning coordinates to services and then tracking services through these coordinates. Services can use Cloudname to announce endpoints and accept configuration. Clients can resolve endpoints and keep track of these even when services go down, come up, and move to different physical nodes in a cluster.
Cloudname is an open source Apache licensed system for running services in the cloud (available from http://github.com/cloudname). The system consists of two parts: Nodee, which is a very simple service for provisioning and managing software artifacts and running processes in a distributed system. The other part is the Cloudname library, which is used for coordination of services in a distributed system. (Usually when we refer to Cloudname, we mean the Cloudname library). The Cloudname library aims to provide a minimal set of coordination and configuration services needed to run large distributed systems. It takes care of mapping and tracking services independently of physical their physical location. Services are assigned coordinates. When a service starts it will claim its coordinate. Once a coordinate has been claimed the service can use this to publish endpoints. Clients can resolve endpoints by way of resolver expressions. It is an important point that Cloudname is implemented as a library that uses Apache ZooKeeper to perform its heavy lifting.

Learn how a group of developers from SAP's IT division evolved over a period of two years from using an ageing Java 1.4-era set of skills & tools to become a Scrum-based team using Continuous Delivery to create a secure, highly-available and mission-critical part of SAP's cloud platform.
The SAP ID Service is SAP's identity management system for its websites and cloud operations. The team that built it came from a background of writing web applications in Java 1.4 for an ageing and proprietary platform where it took up to a week just to deploy a new release after it had passed mostly manual QA. With the SAP ID Service project starting in 2010 the team rebooted itself: we adopted Scrum and started building the SAP ID Service using a lean, modern and standards-based application server built from open source components and using Continuous Delivery for build, test and deployment. We are now at the stage where each commit leads to a build with automated test coverage via Cucumber followed by a blue/green deployment to a production-like QA landscape which is provisioned from a cloud and configured automatically using Chef. A similar deployment to production is just a couple of clicks away, and the cloud-based technology used for this also enables developers to provision their own landscapes using a simple web-based tool. This talk will describe our journey, not only sharing our experiences but also welcoming questions and stories from others in the room.
Darren Hague is an engineering architect in SAP Global IT's Web & Knowledge Management group. He has spent the last 10 years working in the area of identity management and single-sign on, specialising in the use of Java in the SAP ecosystem. Although his title says Architect he writes code more often than he writes PowerPoint slides, and he has spent the last couple of years working in the team that built a core component of SAP's cloud offering, the SAP ID Service. A speaker at SAP TechEd and Community Day conferences, he is also a SAP Mentor alumnus, co-organiser of annual SAP Inside Track London events, and author of the SAP Press book "Universal Worklist with SAP NetWeaver Portal".

An introduction to MongoDB, the highly scalable document oriented database, with discussion various integration points for MongoDB & the JVM including Spring's "Spring Data" component for MongoDB, the Morphia Object Mapper for Java, MongoDB's Scala Driver "Casbah", Mongo-Backed Akka Durable Mailboxes, Salat for Object & Case Class Mapping between MongoDB and Scala, and MongoDB's Hadoop integration.
MongoDB is a scalable, high-performance, open source, document-oriented NoSQL database. It features document-oriented, JSON-based document storage and dynamic schemas providing simplicity, power and flexibility, combined with full indexes similar to what a traditional RDBMS user would expect. MongoDB also provides solid replication & high availability features as well as an auto-sharding system for transparent horizontal scalability. This talk introduces MongoDB for developers who aren't familiar with it, and discusses various integration points for MongoDB & the JVM including Spring's "Spring Data" component for MongoDB, the Morphia Object Mapper for Java, MongoDB's Scala Drivers (Casbah, as well as a new experimental Asynchronous driver called "Hammersmith"), Akka Durable Mailboxes, the Salat Object-Document mapping system for Scala, and MongoDB's Hadoop integration.
Brendan maintains and supports the Java driver, as well as providing support for alternative JVM languages. He is currently developing a Hadoop integration plugin for MongoDB. Brendan's open source work related to MongoDB includes contributions to MongoKit, a Python object mapper for MongoDB as well as the creation of beaker_mongodb, a MongoDB persistence layer for the popular Python-based Beaker caching system. Brendan also created Casbah, a Scala toolkit for MongoDB. He is currently spending his spare time working on Hammersmith, an alternative asynchronous & non-blocking Scala driver for MongoDB.

Enterprise search can grow big, really big! Using the world's most popular Open Source search engine, Apache Solr™, we will show you how the new upcoming version 4.0 makes scaling search in the cloud really simple and robust, using the new SolrCloud feature set.
h1. Problem Enterprise search can grow big, really big! And growing. Tens, yes hundreds of servers may be involved, locally or in the cloud. Managing this has been complex and time consuming - until now :) h1. SolrCloud to the rescue Using the world's most popular Open Source search engine, Apache Solr™, we will show you how the new upcoming version 4.0 makes scaling search in the cloud really simple and robust. A new feature called SolrCloud adds centralized configuration, distributed indexing & searching, automatic failover, recovery and leader election. Scaling is now as simple as adding a new server to your cluster and it will find its role where it is most needed and start serving searches.

Discover Ceylon, a new and modern language where you can say more, more clearly. We will walk you through our philosophy, features, tool set, ecosystem and community to help you get started in Ceylon.
Ceylon is a new programming language designed to execute on the JVM. We're fans of Java and its ecosystem. However, we think that the language and class libraries, designed more than 15 years ago, are no longer the best foundation for a range of today's business computing problems. Ceylon's design goals include: - easy to learn and understand for Java and C# developers, - eliminate some of Java's verbosity, but keep its readability, - improve upon Java's typesafety, - provide a declarative syntax for expressing hierarchical information (user interface, external data, system configuration) - support and encourage a more functional style of programming with immutable objects and higher-order functions, - great support for meta-programming, - built-in modularity. Come and join us for this introduction to Ceylon where we will show you its main features as well as the ongoing progress of the compiler, IDE, tools and the community behind it.
From deep into the Nice mountains, Stéphane works for Red Hat on the Ceylon project. Passionate hacker in Java, C, Perl or Scheme. A web standards and database enthusiast, he implemented among other things a WYSIWYG XML editor, a multi-threading library in C, a mobile-agent language in Scheme (compiler and virtual machines), and some Web 2.0 RESTful services and rich web interfaces with JavaScript and HTML 5.

Interrested in developing an Android app? Learn about the possibilities using Ruby on Android!
Android has made great advances the last couple of years, and is one of the major actors in the phone ad tablet markets. The main programming language on Android is Java. Android offers a comprehensive API to apps running on the Dalvik VM. The API covers a large part of the Java standard library in addition to Android specific APIs. Android includes tooling to convert Java .class files to Dalvik VM compatible class files. Ruboto uses JRuby to allow you to run Ruby scripts on the Dalvik VM. Using Ruby code, you have access to the complete Android API. Currently, there are two offerings: ruboto and ruboto-irb. Ruboto is a framework and tool chain to develop stand-alone Android apps in Ruby. Ruboto-IRB is an interactive Ruby environment for learning, exploration, development, and testing. This presentation will introduce the different parts of Ruboto: * Installation * Hello World * Development tools * Emulator * Combine Java and Ruby in the same project * Limitations * Release There is a lot happening both on Android, JRuby, and Ruboto, and I'd like to present the last months development, and present the road map for the project. See what Ruboto has to offer.
Core committer on the Ruboto project, and committer on the JRuby project. Employed at Datek Wireless AS in Norway where I develop M2M and fleet control systems on the Java platform, most often using JRuby. Started programming in 1980, and hope to keep coding til the day I die.

Software architectures are the the firm foundations on which successful products are constructed, but if a product is successful over the long term its architecture will not only need to evolve, but must be actively defended against malignant forces.
Much has been made of the need to establish software architectures to provide the firm foundations on which successful products are constructed, but if a product is successful over the long term its architecture will not only need to evolve, but must be actively defended against malignant forces. The fact that software architectures tend to outlive the tenure of developers, architects, management teams and even companies makes the maintenance of software architectures over the long term crucial for the ability of products to deliver ongoing value. What happens to the architecture of established systems in an environment where concurrent feature delivery projects make architectural ‘adjustments’ for their own ends? How can erosion of this shared architecture be managed across multiple teams? How can projects acting in their own best interests avoid over-exploiting the common architectural resource on which they all depend? Should ownership of the architecture be distributed and shared, or centralised and tightly controlled? Perhaps most importantly, can we detect when the architecture has been violated? This talk explores how shared resources in other fields are managed for the common good, and draws analogies and lessons which can be applied to the shared ‘resource’ of a software architecture. Examples garnered from over twelve years working with greenfield and legacy software systems illustrate how to diagnose, understand the causes of, and address the erosion of application architectures so that products can flourish and be productive for future generations.

While porting an old application used for performing oil spill risk assessment, we were tasked with improving performance for a complex analysis. The end result is a 98% performance boost, using commodity Laptop-grade hardware and standardized software.
While porting an old application used for performing oil spill risk assessment, the task was to optimize the speed at which the processing of about 5GB worth of textual, tab separated, structural input files were analyzed. The process ended up split into separate tasks, each performing its own part of the parsing and analysis. This talk will outline the steps we went through in order to optimize and achieve a performance gain of roughly 98% - from 24 hours to 24 minutes - while keeping the application running on a commodity hardware laptop computer (A quad core MacBook Pro), Java Standard Edition 6 and standard, open-source frameworks.

Puppet is an infrastructure-as-code tool that allows easy provisioning of servers. This session will show you how to code the infrastructure needed for your developments: JDKs, database servers, application servers, web applications, and all supporting services, in an automated and repeatable way, that can be easily used in hardware or virtual machines during development, QA or production.
Puppet is an infrastructure-as-code tool that allows easy and automated provisioning of servers, defining the packages, configuration, services,... in code. Enabling DevOps culture, tools like Puppet help drive Agile development all the way to operations and systems administration, and along with continuous integration tools like Jenkins, it is a key piece to accomplish repeatability and continuous delivery, automating the operations side during development, QA or production, and enabling testing of systems configuration. Traditionally a field for system administrators, Puppet can empower developers, allowing both to collaborate coding the infrastructure needed for their developments, whether it runs in hardware, virtual machines or cloud. Developers and sysadmins can define what JDK version must be installed, application server, version, configuration files, war and jar files,... and easily make changes that propagate across all nodes. Using Vagrant, a command line automation layer for VirtualBox, they can also spin off virtual machines in their local box, easily from scratch with the same configuration as production servers, do development or testing and tear them down afterwards. We’ll show how to install and manage Puppet nodes with JDK, multiple application server instances with installed web applications, database, configuration files and all the supporting services. Including getting up and running with Vagrant and VirtualBox for quickstart and Puppet experiments, as well as setting up automated testing of the Puppet code.

The most important question to be asked when developing a new software system is "How will we replace it?"
The most important question to be asked when developing a new software system is "How will we replace it?" It is however a question seldom asked. Instead organization focus on reusability, which unfortunately helps create rigid and inflexible architectures. The talk shows how to design systems made up of small parts, why you should standardize on protocol and not platform and how you will end with a system that is easier to scale and maintain.

Memory leaks can cause OutOfMemoryError. Know how to detect and - even better - avoid them.
In Java, memory leaks take the form of “unwanted references”, i.e., references that keep objects alive that are no longer needed by any part of your program. If these “forgotten” objects pile up they might even cause an OutOfMemoryError. The session explains various kinds of memory leaks, how they happen, and how they can be detected using tools (profilers and heap dump analyzers).

Bringing a modern web startup culture into one of the world's oldest institutions.
Starting in February 2010 a small group of developers, designers and product sculptors began work on http://alpha.gov.uk, demonstrating what a new, simplified and unified website for the UK government might look and feel like. It's been rapidly followed by public betas and the outcome of that work is intended to become the official UK government website before the end of 2012. This talk tells the story of bringing a modern web startup culture into one of the world's oldest institutions.
James Stewart is a software developer based in London with his wife and two small kids. Having been building things for the web since the mid-90s, he was technical lead for Alpha.gov.uk and now works as a technical architect for the Government Digital Service helping shape a new open-source platform for the UK Government.

Application security must be solved by the people building it! Luckily, the basics of appsec are surprisingly simple. Understand what the problems are, how they might apply to your application, and how you can solve them.
As applications grow and mature to become a natural and integral part of business, government and society as a whole, so does the demands for application security. Often ill-defined, often poorly understood by decision makers, it’s never the less critical for any internet facing system. Application security is no longer optional. It can no longer be an afterthought. It cannot be addressed by adding another box to the server room. It cannot be outsourced, nor can it easily be retrofitted. Security must be designed and built into mission critical applications from the beginning, and the only people in a position to do this are the ones building it. Luckily, the basics of application security are surprisingly simple. In this introductory talk, we'll delve look into what every application developer needs to know about security, regardless of whether you see yourself as a backend or frontend person, or what language you prefer. We'll look into the basic forms of the most common threats and mitigation in some detail, in order to assist you in recognizing where problems may occur, what might happen, against whom and in what circumstances. And most importantly: how to best address them in your own applications. This will include subjects such as important security patterns, injection attacks, cross site scripting, cross site request forgery and session hijacking. The talk will focus on concrete examples, demonstrating both the issues and important tools and techniques for the responsible developer.

Video content is increasingly playing an important role on the web today. This talk covers everything you need to work effectively with video using Java and HTML5. Whether your plan is to build the next Youtube or just to add some video to your web site, this talk covers everything you need to get started.
Video content is playing an increasingly important role on the web today. Video provides an engaging and effective way of conveying your message to an audience. Yet as programmers, lack of tooling has made it difficult for us to access video. This talk covers everything you need to work effectively with video using Java and HTML5. After introducing the basic concepts of frames, codecs and container formats, we'll dive into video production, analysis and transformation using the open source library Xuggler. We'll then show you how to consume video in the browser using HTML5 video and Javascript. We'll also cover new APIs giving programmatic access to the user's webcam and how to process live video with effects in the browser using the Canvas API. The format of the talk is a mix of slides covering the theory with some fun demos showing what kind of video solutions you can create using what you've learned. Whether your plan is to build the next Youtube or you just want to add some video to your web site, this talk covers everything you need to get started.

The presentation covers how to tackle Android fragmentation, and how to write highly portable applications for both phones and tablets. ICS is out, and the adoption is steady but slow. Developers will have to support a large number of Android versions in years to come.
The number of Android powered devices are sky rocketing. To reach larger audiences, developers want to create applications that are compatible with as many devices as possible. Ice Cream Sandwich brings together tablet- and phone development, but adoption however steady is still slow. This results in developers having to cope with different Android versions for years to come. The diversity of devices running the operating system provide great freedom of choice for consumers. On the other hand, screen sizes, form factors and capabilities vary dramatically and provide additional challenges for developers. The presentation will cover how to use fragments to achieve a high level of code reuse in the UI layer. The presentation will also cover how to use the Android compatibility package to build applications that can be installed, from a single APK to both phones and tablets. The topics will be explained using code, and a complete overview of how to write highly portable Android applications will be given during the presentation.

A simple, monolithic web applications that serve up HTML to desktop browsers no longer satisfies the requirements of modern applications. In this talk, you will learn how to decompose your application into a set of narrowly focused, independently deployable back-end services with a NodeJS and HTML 5 front-end.
Today, there are several trends that are forcing application architectures to evolve. Users expect a rich, interactive and dynamic user experience on a wide variety of clients including mobile devices. Applications must be highly scalable, highly available and run on cloud environments. Organizations often want to frequently roll out updates, even multiple times a day. Consequently, it’s no longer adequate to develop simple, monolithic web applications that serve up HTML to desktop browsers. In this talk we describe the limitations of a monolithic architecture. You will learn how to use the scale cube to decompose your application into a set of narrowly focused, independently deployable back-end services and an HTML 5 client. We will also discuss the role of technologies such as NodeJS and AMQP brokers. You will learn how a modern PaaS such as Cloud Foundry simplifies the development and deployment of this style of application.

Software craftsmen learn continuously to keep adding value to his current work and repertoire. Getting Things Done (GTD) workflow helps software craftsmen to get organized with their responsibilities as well as their professional and personal development in a stress free way.
As aspiring software craftsmen you learn continuously, catching up with the existing and new things that can add value to your current work and repertoire. Let’s say you read a tech article or listen to an episode of your favorite podcast and find yourselves with references that inspire you to check further. What do you do to make sure that you will give those ideas enough attention to decide effectively whether you want to act on it or not? Do you keep a mental “check-later” list and never actually check them because you simply forget it or too busy to get back to it? Getting Things Done (GTD) system presents a workflow that will help us get organized with our responsibilities as well as our professional and personal development, based on the natural way we deal with our work: we (1) "collect" things that command our attention; (2) "process" them to know what they mean and what to do about them; and (3) "organize" the results, which we (4) "review" as options for what we choose to (5) "do". One of the challenges to get organized in the conventional ways, like making list and schedules, is that we tend to do all the five phases at one time. Selecting too early will list out things we consider unimportant relative to other “critical” things on the list or simply because we don’t know how to act on it now. Leaving things open will take up energy and prevent us from having a totally effective, clear focus of what is important. Since the first time GTD was invented, tools have been created to make it easier to implement GTD as part of our daily life with the least interruption. We will have a look at some of the available tools in comparison.

ClojureScript is a dialect of Clojure built especially for rich front-end applications in the browser. What better application to show than an agent model of cows inside an electric fence? We'll take a good look at an exciting language and learn useful principles to help us keep the anxiety level of our herd as low as possible.
ClojureScript is a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript, and targets the JavaScript runtimes of the web as a deployment environment. It offers the unparalleled expressiveness of Lisp, the performance and space efficiency of the Google Closure Compiler, interoperability with the in-browser object model, and natural integration with server-side Clojure applications. In a time of proliferating JavaScript extensions and client-side development frameworks, this is a compelling vision of how client-side web development should be done. It's also a great language in which to write an agent model. In this talk, we'll dissect an entirely client-side simulation of a pen full of cows inside an electric fence. Each cow moves around randomly, and is sensitive to the stress level of the cows around it. When a cow wanders into the electric fence, we can explore simulation parameters that determine how stress moves through the herd. We'll learn how to write ClojureScript, and draw fascinating parallels to human behavior in real-life emotional systems.

Want to program to iOS but don't want to deal with Objective-C? Don't want to buy a Mac just to build iPhone apps? Want to build Windows Phone apps but don't want to switch to Windows or port to C#? Java to the rescue! Make WORA real again for mobile programming thanks to the open source community.
Thanks to the open source community it is now entirely possible to use Java in order to build native applications for iOS, Android, RIM, Windows Phone etc. without the compromises that HTML5 imposes. The talk focuses on the open source Codename One project, which started its life within Sun Microsystems and eventually grew into a full grassroots project as its founders left Sun. As part of the talk we will build an application live on stage and demonstrate how it can be instantly deployed to devices. The talk is based on two highly attended talks that were given in Java One 2012 covering this very subject.

Like chocolate and peanut butter, Dart and Web Components go great together. Learn how to build structured, declarative apps with modern web platform features, and deploy them across the modern web today. Don't wait for all browsers to implement the great new Web Components specs, let Dart and its Web UI framework make it a reality today.
Like chocolate and peanut butter, Dart and Web Components go great together. Learn how to build structured, declarative apps with modern web platform features, and deploy them across the modern web today. Don't wait for all browsers to implement the great new Web Components specs, let Dart and its Web UI framework make it a reality today. Dart's language features such as classes, static types, and libraries brings order and scalability to the chaos. Web Components' features such as encapsulation, reusability, and declarative semantics helps you "say what you mean" and avoid soup. Web UI's declarative and dynamic two-way data binding efficiently wires up your app. Best part: it all compiles to vanilla HTML and JavaScript to bring you the best of the future web today so you can deploy access the modern web browsers.

The talk, split into two sections and drawing from a real implementation covers potential NoSQL architectures and the features they offer in the quest to reach the Holy Grail AKA linear scalability. Presentation will describe a real-world implementation delivered for a global on-line travel agency using Infinispan.
The talk, split into two sections and drawing from a real implementation covers potential NoSQL architectures and the features they offer in the quest to reach the Holy Grail AKA linear scalability. First we examine an existing traditional replicated cache running at full capacity and how replacement with a distributed solution allowed the application to scale dramatically with a performance improvement to boot. Secondly we look at one of the pitfalls of distributed caching and how, using an essential tool from the Data Grid functionality armory, namely grid-execution we can provide massive scale out and low latencies. Both parts describe a real-world implementation delivered for a global on-line travel agency using Infinispan.

Learn how to building modern, scalable, reactive and resilient applications, ready for the real-time web.
The skills of building Event-Driven, Highly Concurrent, Scalable & Resilient Systems are becoming increasingly important in our new world of Cloud Computing, multi-core processors, Big Data and Real-Time Web. Unfortunately, many people are still doing it wrong; using the wrong tools, techniques, habits and ideas. In this talk we will look at what it means to 'Go Reactive' and discuss some of the most common (and some not so common but superior) practices; what works - what doesn't work - and why.

Never ever experience schema validaition errors on startup again.
Numerous tools exists to help you deploy database schema change scripts, provided you've remembered to create them. To help you remember, we have employed unit tests that break the build immediately if you add new persistent fields without also writing a correct delta script. In this talk I'll show you how to make that fly.

Do you have a product manager? Maybe it's time to stop. Come explore the idea that we should do away with "Product Manager" as a defined role, and ask developers to be the masters of their own domain.
By now, we are all comfortable with the orthodoxy: the product owner discerns the needs of the customer and feeds them to developers in the form a prioritized backlog. Developers pull work from that backlog, always confident that they're working on the highest-priority feature at the moment, and never having to worry about how those priorities are allocated. This system is simple, efficient, and has helped many teams function better than they used to. It's also time for the system to die. A few revolutionary companies are experimenting with the idea that developers should be in charge not only of when they build new features, but _what_ features to build. Rather than mere code technicians following the will of a product and marketplace expert, developers themselves become experts in their product domain, building the tools users need—by conceiving of those tools themselves. Dispensing with the product owner creates an entirely new organizational tenor: one in which everyone is encouraged to master the business's domain, to organize their work in autonomous ways, and to take ownership of the purpose for which the organization exists.

I'll show you a fully functional web application built using java 8, without JPA/Hibernate or CDI/Spring. I hope you'll come away inspired by the realization that you have the power to create your own solutions, instead of blindly consuming other people's frameworks.
When it comes to storing data, we've gone from direct communication with relational databases, to standardized ORMs and now we seem to be moving on to No SQL storage solutions. While I fully understand the desire to get away from ORMs like hibernate (here's my rant on that subject from 2011: http://vimeo.com/28885655), I think we're moving in the wrong direction. Instead of moving away from RDBs we should be moving towards them. ORMs let you abstract yourself away from the database. But why would you want to do that? Relational databases are great! Much better for storing data than your typical object oriented domain model. I'm not going to show you the next big framework everybody should be using to communicate with databases, but I want to demonstrate how thinking differently about database access can lead to some pretty decent solutions. You can get a lot done, quite painlessly, with plain old java. And by writing things from scratch, for a particular application, you can get away with much simpler code than you could if you were writing a fancy generic framework. Most importantly though, you learn so much more and have tons more fun. I'll be showing you a fully functional application, and the code behind it. While the code will be freely accessible online, I hope nobody uses it, but instead feel inspired to go off and write their own solutions. It's by trying new things that the world moves forwards. I want us to become creators again, not simply consumers of other people's frameworks.

We'll question the initial architecture decisions in building large systems, and discuss how to approach design differently. Allow for diversity while maintaining integrity, and avoid falling into the trap of making technology choices with too much rigor.
In any system of significant size, the same problem occurs again and again: What starts out as a light-weight, modern, efficient development effort using the technology of the day – be it Java and Java EE or Spring, Microsoft .NET, Ruby on Rails or any other of the well-known development stacks – ends up as a hard to change, monolithic, maintenance-intensive behemoth that everybody wants to get away from. But what are the core reason for this recurring pattern? In this session, we will discuss how and why things always seem to end up this way, and what strategies we can use to avoid this from the start.

Worried about who's getting access to your app? Sprinkle in XACML and get access control that is both context-aware, externalized and dynamic.
Need to add more than basic access control to your application? Existing authorization frameworks including their pros and cons, but are typically quite limited. This talk will introduce XACML, the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language, an authorization standard from OASIS that defines fine-grained access control based on attributes. The XACML standard enables much more dynamic authorization that not only focuses on the user but also on resources, actions, and the context. XACML enables policy-based and attribute-based access control. The talk with then look at how XACML can be used to apply authorization business rules to any Java application and even beyond (.NET, Ruby...). This is known as “any-breadth authorization”. XACML also enables consistent authorization across multiple layers (presentation tier; web tier; business tier; and data tier). It becomes possible to apply the same authorization logic in a JSF page as in a jdbc connection. This is also known as “any-depth authorization” During the talk, we will look at live examples of applications using XACML. For instance, we will demonstrate the use of XACML and Java servlets, JAX-WS web services, and APIs as a whole. Attendees will also be able to write their own XACML policies, provided they download the ALFA plugin for Eclipse, an add-on for XACML policy authoring. In January 2013, XACML 3.0 was approved as a formal standard and there are several implementations available (open-source, free, and commercial) for developers to get started. The talk will illustrate how developers can leverage XACML to quickly apply authorization to new and existing applications. After this session, you will easily be able to add standards-based authorization to your application - and simplify your life!

Do you want to communicate more effectively? Do you want create better maintainable software? If so, come and listen to this presentation to get some hands on tips on techniques and tools.
Visualization is an effective method of communication and there is more than UML. Peter will present methods and tools to visualize your system's architecture and design (or lack of it) and the theories behind. Using the methods and tools you will be able to prove a technical debt and to justify a refactoring for example. You will also be able to visualize how the data in the system looks like from different perspectives in order to detect "information debt" or how the system behaves in operation. The purpose of the presentation is to inspire you to use visualization as a technique to communicate better and to improve the quality of your software.

How can we apply the lessons of functional programming to the design of software systems? How can we make software more transparent to developers? Using examples in Clojure, this talk will discuss ways to think about data, processes, isolation, and visibility.
One reason programming is hard is because it is so difficult to observe what is happening when a program runs. Programming languages and libraries rely on abstractions which either hide important details or produce too much information to consume. Developers come to depend on ever-more-sophisticated tools to examine programs and diagnose failures. However, with a little care and design, it is possible to build systems which lend themselves to easier comprehension. This talk will introduce some general guidelines for designing systems which make their data and abstractions more transparent to developers, using code examples in Clojure.

Use Java(FX) on embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi or the BeagleBoard xM to do something useful with it like monitoring the temperature.
Usually Java developers do not create code for embedded devices because there was no good Java support on these devices. Oracle figured out that there is a huge market for embedded devices and decided to support Java and JavaFX on hardware like the very popular Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBoard xM. With Java technology available on these platforms it's very interesting to see what you can do with this. This session will give you a short overview on the available technologies and will explain the interaction between different technologies and where they make sense. As an example a temperature monitoring application will be shown using JavaFX on a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBoard xM and on the Desktop. In addition a little HTML5 page for mobile will be presented too.

This session will show different strategies for accessing off-heap memory and using the advantage of large RAM without paying the performance penalty.
Cheap RAM means we can use more memory than an average disk size was not that long time ago. It's very tempting to increase size of our JVM heap and store more data in-memory. As always, there is a trade-off: Large heaps lead to higher latencies due to Garbage Collector overhead. This session will show different strategies for accessing off-heap memory and using the advantage of large RAM without paying the performance penalty.

Is Software Design dead? How does development differ between application development and library development? And how do you not alienate your users when they're actually other developers?
Agile methodologies have had us moving away from Big Up Front Design to evolutionary, emergent design. But how does that work in the real world? Using experiences gained when creating the new Java driver for MongoDB, Trisha takes us on a design journey, where the answer to every question is It Depends, the users of the system and their use cases are unknown, and lurking at the back of every decision is the question âbut will it be backwards compatible?â Weâve all been there, trying to work out how to implement requirements, but have we really thought about the process of design? Beware Monsters.
Trisha is a developer at MongoDB, where she maintains the Java driver. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and has a wide breadth of industry experience from the 12 years she's been a professional developer. Trisha is a leader in the London Java Community, and involved in the Graduate Development Community, she believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again.

Pushing a new release into production is always raising the stress-level of the developers. By using beta-users and implementing functional switches in the release we can isolate bugs or avoid exposing functionality without having to do a new release. Stress-level is down and quality is up.
Pushing a new release into production is always raising the stress-level of the developers. Sometimes functionality also has to be taken out of a release because of bugs, lack of time to test it, or a general uncertainty from the product owner if this actually is the right thing. Rolling back a release is not fun either. To keep our four-week release-cycles and avoid the overhead with last minute changes to the release, or building emergency patches, we introduced beta-users as a role in the system. We also started to add functional switches on all new complicated functionality or parts of the functionality. In this way we can expose new functionality or new layout only to a group of users, and we are able to partly put functionality into production or turn of buggy functionality without deploying the application. Our experiences with this is that it has become more used by the product owners to release new functionality according to their schedule, than by the DevOps-people to hold things back. We have also avoided both rollback and emergency-patching thanks to this.

BASE transactions are changing the way we have to develop applications dramatically - a lot more than most people think in the first place. This session not only explains why but also gives you a step by step introduction how to make your application BASE-ready based on real code examples. Let's get ready to survive in a BASE world!
NoSQL, Big Data and Scale-out in general are leaving the hype plateau and start to become enterprise reality. This usally means no more ACID tranactions, but BASE transactions instead. When confronted with BASE, many developers just shrug and think "Okay, no more SQL but that's basically it, isn't it?". They are terribly wrong! BASE transactions do not guarantee data consistency at all times anymore, which is a property we became so used to in the ACID years that we barely think about it anymore. But if we continue to design and implement our applications as if there still were ACID transactions, system crashes and corrupt data will become your daily company. This session gives a quick introduction into the challenges of BASE transactions and explains how to design and implement a BASE-aware application using real code examples. We start with a pure ACID application and transform it step by step into a BASE application. Additionally we extract some concrete idioms along the way in order to preserve the ideas in a concise way. Let's get ready to survive in a BASE world!

When the wise, bearded men designed Java, there was one piece of the puzzle they just didn't get around to finishing: Modularity. This talk explains the benefits of modular architectures and shows you how to implement it for Java based applications.
Back when the Java language and platform was designed there was one piece of the puzzle that the wise bearded men just couldn't get around to finishing properly: Modularity. Modularity done right can be incredibly liberating for your team: Features can be developed, tested and deployed independently. The need for branching and merging evaporates. Dead code can be efficiently and safely removed from your codebase. Developers can innovate and experiment without risking their sleep. People outside your team are free to extend your software without having to ask. They don't even need to know you exist. So if modularity has all of these benefits, why don't we see a lot more of it? Because implementing modularity on you own is hard and tricky. OSGi was promising, but failed to deliver because it was too complex. This talk shows you how to efficiently add modularity code base today. We start by presenting modularity as an architectural pattern and describe a structured approach to designing modular APIs. We then dive into the technical implementation of developing, packaging, distributing and deploying modules on the Java platform. We finish off by showing some real life implementations of modular Java systems.

This is a story about how to scale better and faster by keeping it simple. Two prototypes, 0MQ vs HTTP, and one winner. The story is told through our marquee high performance Varnish Cache invalidation product, written in Java, that is capable of 45 thousand cache invalidations per second with ease using only basic HTTP. We aim to share some experience, lessons and fun along the way.
This is a story about how to scale better and faster by keeping it simple, told through our marquee high performance Varnish Cache invalidation product, written in Java. The cache invalidation product, known as the “Super Fast Purger”, is a RESTful API that is designed to deliver purge requests to multiple geographically distributed Varnish Cache installations. The current implementation is capable of receiving and distributing 45 000 thousand cache invalidation requests per second with ease. It is believed that the upper limit of the throughput is yet to be determined for the Super Fast Purger as the software implementation was limited to network and hardware capabilities during benchmarking. The Super Fast Purger was conceived as a plugin for the Varnish Administration Console. Prior to the commercial release of the cache invalidation product, two prototypes were developed internally. The first was a highly concurrent and sophisticated prototype with 0MQ, Protobuffer and Disruptor as key components. The second prototype was development without any external packages, APIs or frameworks. By utilising only native Java 1.6 SE, a subset of HTTP 1.1 protocol was implemented and a simple HTTP server was conceived as the RESTful platform to handle purge requests. With stark contrast in development approach and technology choices, the two prototypes were benchmarked, tested and compared. The findings is that the simple HTTP server as a RESTful platform out performed the highly sophisticated and concurrent prototype by a factor of 100. This presentation aims to share the findings, lessons, and the fun experience that was the Super Fast Purger.

This talk will present the configuration system designed to manage run-time configuration for some of Yahoo!s serving systems; describing how this system, developed by a small development team in Trondheim, tackles some of the very real challenges when managing a large distributed system.
Managing a small system is simple. But as a system grows, more services are added, and data and computation needs to be distributed. All of a sudden, you find yourself in a configuration nightmare, where both the time needed to change the configuration and human errors made in the process increase. A large scale system typically involves thousands of hosts, and multiple processes running on each of those hosts. Cloud platforms such as Heroku and Amazon tries to simplify this by providing higher level abstractions of the services and how they are connected. This requires that they run some system management of the software running inside the cloud. In Yahoo!, we run large scale systems, and this talk will describe the configuration system developed by a small development team in Trondheim to manage run-time configuration for many of Yahoo!’s serving systems. The talk will present how our configuration system grew from a simple set of config files to a generic configuration system for the cloud. It will describe how it works, and what we used to build it.

Explore the disconnect between the dire outcomes for dynamic language programs predicted by advocates of static typing, versus the near absence of type errors in real world systems built in Python, Ruby and Clojure and the many successful systems built in dynamic languages.
Some programming language theorists would have us believe that the one true path to working systems lies in powerful and expressive type systems which allow us to encode rich constraints into programs at the time they are created. If these academic computer scientists would get out more, they would soon discover an increasing incidence of software developed in languages such a Python, Ruby and Clojure which use dynamic, albeit strong, type systems. They would probably be surprised to find that much of this software—in spite of their well-founded type-theoretic hubris—actually works, and is indeed reliable out of all proportion to their expectations. This talk—given by an experienced polyglot programmer who once implemented Hindley Milner static type inference for “fun”, but who now builds large and successful systems in Python—explores the disconnect between the dire outcomes predicted by advocates of static typing versus the near absence of type errors in real world systems built with dynamic languages: Does diligent unit testing more than make up for the lack of static typing? Does the nature of the type system have only a low-order effect on reliability compared to the functional or imperative programming paradigm in use? How often is the dynamism of the type system used anyway? How much type information can JITs exploit at runtime? Does the unwarranted success of dynamically typed languages get up the nose of people who write Haskell? For the answers to these important questions, and more, don’t miss this session.

Never change your data
If you are used to traditional databases, then to only append and never update your data may sound like a crazy idea. However, not only does this enable historical queries, but also enhances fault tolerance and scalability. In this presentation we briefly describe two immutable data stores (Rich Hickey's Datomic and Greg Young's EventStore) and compare their different data models using an example problem domain. Along the way we learn about CQRS, Aggregates, Projections and why you want your data to be immutable. EventStore is a data store for applications using event sourcing and time-series data. EventStore runs on .NET and Mono. Datomic is a database of time-based facts, with declarative queries and ACID transactions. Datomic is written in Clojure and runs on the JVM.

Making I/O programs compose Reactive programming
IO is usually quite hard to tackle in a functional way. The predominant paradigm for I/O is the cursor. A cursor is a data structure that holds the current state of an I/O resource and provides a function to retrieve the next data available from that resource. This approach lacks some very properties we functional programmers care about: - composability Writing explicit I/O loops makes to hard to compose - not functional Ideally we write functions that transform input to output but pull based I/O (where you read the chunks) makes it hard to write pure functions There are already libraries that provides some abstraction to overcome these shortcomings but somehow lacks in composability. In this presentation I will explore Enumeration based I/O with iteratee and how that makes I/O operations both functional and efficient. I will take some real world example use cases using Play framework where this approach has been used with success.

So your project is just getting started. Or maybe you're just about to embark on a new release. Or new members just joined the team. What now? The attention and enthusiasm in your project will never be higher than now. This talk shows how to get the most out of it.
So your project is just getting started. Or maybe you're just about to embark on a new release. Or new members just joined the team. What now? In either situation, your project will have a lot of energy and attention right now. But at the same time, there's probably a lot of uncertainty about what to do first. Many projects waste this valuable time without a clear plan or purpose. In Exilesoft, we have refined activities to deal with these problems, even with the additional constraint that the team may be distributed geographically. In this talk, I share a typical plan of what activities to do every day in the first weeks together with a set of activities which yeld tangible results in terms of team building, vision, architecture and a coherent working system in a minimum of time. Come to this talk if you want to kick start your project and get on the right track fast.

If you want to know what differentiates Backbone.js and Angular.js and get a better feel for which one you should use then feel free to head over.
I'd like to talk about the differences between two popular frontend Javascript frameworks that I've had experience with over the last 1,5 years. I'll give a short introduction to what they are and how they work before I dive into the differences between them, my experience from using them in customer projects and what I consider the pros and cons. This lightning talk does not aim to teach you how to use either one of those frameworks, but may be of interest if you're using one or are planning to. If you're not familiar with either of them you'll still get a quick fly-by on how they'll affect your frontend code and perhaps be in a better position to choose between them. The talk will be held in Norwegian.

Once you realise the true enemy of software development is complexity, not waterfalls, you can start rethinking how we write our software. Come learn why modern languages like Scala and Clojure lead to fundamentally better software systems than any of yesterday's tricks.
Have you noticed that in spite of all our oft repeated Best Practices, those bugs don't seem to stop coming back no matter how many tests we write, that pile of technical debt still seems to keep growing no matter how much we refactor, and we keep missing those deadlines no matter how we organise our scrum board? Perhaps it's time to stop listening to those who shout the loudest and start applying actual reason to the problem for a change. The programming paradigms that served us so well through the 80s and 90s are no longer adequate for developing software in the modern world. Building systems the way we're used to building them always seems to end in the inevitable death march towards exponential complexity. But once you start asking the right question—"what's causing all this complexity?"—the answers turn out to be obvious. Debugging is only hard when you can't reason about your code. Concurrency is only hard when you can't predict the state of your code. Reusability is only hard when your components aren't naturally composable. These problems are what the modern generation of functional programming languages—Scala, Erlang, Clojure—have been designed from the ground up to overcome. This is what the really smart people in our field have been up to lately, and it's really time you put down those Post-Its and come let me show you why it's a really, really big deal.

In this session you will learn how to write Java code in a functional way without using Java 8.
You’ve probably heard the buzz about functional programming and you may have glanced at the new Lambda features in Java 8. What is less known is that it's actually possible to leverage some of the functional-style techniques even in older Java versions. This means that you can program in a functional style, even if your organization has not yet updated to Java 8. In this session, you’ll learn about real-world experiences with functional frameworks such as LambdaJ, Functional Java and Guava. What should you consider before adopting them? How do they compare against one another? If you are stuck with a legacy Java version and want to be prepared for the functional future of Java 8, make sure to attend this session.

Learn about a slew of obscure but powerful Java libraries that you just cannot do without once you know they exist. Attention usually focus on the big projects, but there are tons of great gems that solve their little problem so well. We'll learn about more then thirty of those, that you can start using immediately!
Open source library and technology stories tend to be focused around big, famous and established projects. Enough of Spring, Akka and Hadoop: there is much more than just the big guys! The long tail treasure trove is full of hidden gems, libraries, utilities and snippets that make developers' lives easier and provide important functionality. This talk is all about the small stuff that shaves so many hours off of development time and improves productivity by orders of magnitude. We'll learn how off some of the most interesting small itches that got scratched by providing tools you just can't do without once you get to know them. We will present no less than 30 (thirty!) Java Open Source projects, providing code examples and small demos for each one of them. By no means is this intended as a comprehensive view on everything that's in the Long Tail: our expectation is to make attendees aware of the existence, and able to locate more, of a plethora of readily available open source software, while providing a few hints about what are, in our experience, some of the best hidden gems in the “small yet beautiful” landscape.

Git is powerful. It can change the way you interact with your team members when you know what's possible. You will learn Git workflows and direct integrations with ALM tools. Git your team productive and awesome!
Git is not just a version control system. Git can change the way you interact with your team members. Lot's of teams don't think about reflecting their development workflow in Git and just use it out-of-the-box. Git, however, can be much more powerful, giving your team a boost in productivity, protecting your delivery pipeline and helping you to work better together. In this session we will start with a central workflow that is used by a lot of Subversion teams. You will learn how to practically integrate ALM solutions like continuous deployment, code reviews, change tracking and much more into your individual workflow. You will find out how to protect your master branch from accidental commits, broken builds and unreviewed code. This presentation will help you discover the best way to work together as a team - whether you're yet to migrate to Git or even an experienced Git user.

Learn how to build & code a wireless missile-launcher style deployment button with enterprise-grade security for your product manager or team using a Raspberry Pi and some easily-available components.
Continuous Delivery is great, automating the whole build pipeline from commit to QA. However, that final stage of "Deploy release to production" is often still manual, especially in enterprise environments. The Product Manager will give the order, but it's still up to the ops team to perform the actual deployment process when they get the sign-off email. This talk shows you how to build and code a physical deployment box to eliminate that last manual step. Using a Raspberry Pi, some cheap components and a bit of time you can do it for about â¬100. The product manager can now perform the deployment herself by selecting the build number, arming the device with a key, and lifting the missile switch cover to press the deploy button. Outside of performing deployments, the box even works as a build monitor showing the current build with a red or green background to show the build status. You will learn how easy it is to build a Raspberry Pi-based gadget, how to keep its software updated using Chef, and how to securely store enterprise credentials on it.

Chef for developers - what you need to get started with coding your infrastructure
There's a reason Heroku is so popular. As developers we often prefer to focus on coding (and sometimes providing business value) over setting up and maintaining servers and infrastructure. Setting up a full stack with e.g. apache/nginx, containers/wrappers, permissions, monitoring, alerts etc. can be a daunting task if you have not experienced it before. Even more terrifying is the thought of having to do it all again (from memory, or some patchy notes) if the server crashes or you need to scale out horizontally. From a developer's perspective I'll show you how "easily" you can setup your own servers with Chef.

Learn how to provide a powerful command line interface to your JVM with CRaSH the shell for the Java Platform.
CRaSH is an open source shell for extending and monitoring a Java Virtual Machine. The shell can be accessed by various means, either remotely using network protocols such as SSH or locally by attaching a shell to a running virtual machine. Commands are written in the Groovy language and can be developed live making the extensibility of the shell easy with quick development cycles. CRaSH comes with a bunch of commands such as thread management, log management, database access and JMX. The session will begin with an introduction to the shell, showing basic CRaSH features like auto completion and basic commands. The main part of the quickie will focus on showing how to develop CRaSH commands with several examples, showing how easy and powerful the development of a command can be. The target audience is pretty much anyone using a JVM. Attendees will learn how to install CRaSH, connect to an instance and develop a CRaSH command to interact with virtual machine resources or services.

This isn't another JavaFX presentation by a technology evangelist at Oracle. This presentation is about the experiences from using JavaFX in a big commercial project -- the things you don't get by reading the manual.
This session shares the experiences from the development of LoadUI, a large JavaFX-based open source project. The following topics are discussed: • Using JavaFX Scene Builder as a bridge between designers and developers. • GuavaFX – an in-house developed functional library for JavaFX’s ObservableLists. Why the functional paradigm fits JavaFX perfect. • Migrating from 30 000 lines of JavaFX 1. • Automated GUI testing – a simple approach. • Combining MigLayoutFX2 and GroovyFX in a domain specific language. Along the way, you will also see how key JavaFX features, such as real-time charts, custom controls, the WebView, drag-n-drop, animations and effects are being used in LoadUI to make the user interface a competitive advantage.
Henrik Olsson is a Lead Developer and Product Owner at SmartBear Software. The last years he has been working exclusively on software that uses JavaFX to its full extent, including leading the project of converting 30 000 lines worth of JavaFX 1 to JavaFX 2.

Many of the modern web services are RESTful and use hypertext as an interface. But how to assure they are both safe and accessible? OAuth comes in and makes itself comfortable here. This short introductory will walk you through some good practices in hypertext driven interfaces and then will put some light on OAuth 2.0 - standard used even by the biggest players - and its application into our web service.
Many of the modern web services are RESTful and use hypertext as an interface. But how to assure they are both safe and accessible? OAuth comes in and makes itself comfortable here. This short introductory will walk you through some good practices in hypertext driven interfaces and then will put some light on OAuth 2.0 - standard used even by the biggest players - and its application into our web service. When you design RESTful hypertext driven API focus on usability, make it that clear that your users don't need any manual. Make it in the purest way so that it will be accessible for the broadest audience possible. Then, if you will also use OAuth you will spread it even further to be usable out of the box by clients that already use this standard. I will present briefly to participants flow of the authorization and authentication of the protocol and its security aspects. The most important thing is how we can benefit from applying it to our web service? I will point some key areas. For example the resources you want to serve can be and should be divided into logical and consistent parts - each of them require different level of access, which ideally suits to OAuth scopes. But how the whole system could look like? The diagram will show how example system can be composed of and will point out technologies that can be used to build it.

You probably know that you can transmit arbitrary data from point A to B using the internet. But how does this actually work?
You know that the internet lets you send data from A to B, and that it's a global network. But how does this actually happen? Which bits and bytes are transmitted on the copper cables from your computer to the WiFi access point or the plug in the wall, and beyond? What happens when you ping another computer? Why doesn't ping care about port numbers? How can you get an IP address from your router at home, without being a catch 22? How does the router know how to talk to your machine before your machine has an IP address? Why exactly is HTTPS secure? What does the internet lack that requires HTTPS for security?

Writing well behaved http applications is hard. Very hard. But it shouldn't be that way... Unfiltered Directives is a library aiming to solve that problem
Writing well behaved http applications is hard. Very hard. But it shouldn't be that way... Unfiltered Directives is the latest addition to Unfiltered - a Scala toolkit for servicing http requests. Directives is an attempt at making it simpler to write readable and well behaved web applications. By leveraging ideas from monadic parser-combinators, Unfiltered-Directives is a breath of fresh air in a world of ignorant web frameworks. The presentation will demonstrate why http is hard to do right, before diving into a discussion of http, parsing, functional programming, monads and how it all comes together to form a simple and usable library.
Jon-Anders Teigen is software developer from Oslo. He is a co-founder of ScalaBin and Oslo Socially Functional, is co-organizing the flatMap(Oslo) conference, and has previously been part of the JavaZone program committee. Jon-Anders is the author of Unfiltered-Directives.

A lot of people have heard of Event Sourcing, but few has really understood the strength of it. All the discussions you hear about data storage mainly focus on what type of storage you should use, but few discussions focus on what to store. I will in this presentation give a short introduction to event sourcing and why I think it is a good way to store your data.
A lot of people have heard of Event Sourcing, but few has really understood the strength of it. All the discussions you hear about data storage mainly focus on what type of storage mechanism you should use, but few discussions focus on what to store. I will in this presentation give a short introduction to event sourcing and why I think it is a good way to store your data. My goal with this talk is to give you the basic understanding in how to use event sourcing and why you should use it. I will also show you how event sourcing could guide you building better software focusing on what the business really need instead of just storing data.

How do you know what to build of your customer wants a "secure solution with a good amount of flexibility and user friendliness"? You don't! Force the customer to be more specific!
Maximizing customer value is one of the most important guiding principles in agile development practices. After some years with experience with agile practices, we now see that an exclusive focus on value expressed as functionality can seriously undermine the quality of the software product. This manifests itself as bad usability, poor performance or unchangeable software. This has led to a slightly stronger focus on code quality and software architecture to solve these issues. But in all project environments resources; time and money, are limited and the owners of the project initiative want value for money. Quality is also perceived as a technical or architectural issue not something the product owner should care (or know something) about. It is much more difficult to measure quality compared to time, cost or functionality, so it's hard to know if you're delivering software with sufficient quality or not. And if you can't measure quality it's difficult to challenge your development team on it. This is where measurable quality requirements come to the rescue. In this talk I will suggest how you handle and formulate quality requirements in a way that lets the customer - prioritize between different quality attributes - prioritize between quality and cost - measure if acceptable quality is delivered I will also explain the clear distinction between two types of non-functional requirements, constraints (technology, design, architecture) and quality requirements.

Managing Asynchronicity in JavaScript with RQ
Turn based servers such as Nodejs are now joining turn based browsers in providing race-free and deadlock-free interactivity. The event-driven model has long been popular in UI systems, but the nature of work in servers presents some new challenges. Functional programming provides solutions, including monads, arrows, promises, and various flavors of FRP. This is another such solution, targeted specifically to the challenges of high performance web applications.

Every statement in your system is a potential defect. How can know for sure that your test suite will catch these bugs? By using mutation testing tools you will be able to run your tests on an automatically mutated version of your codebase and actually verify that not only has your code been run in your tests. They discover the bugs that may or may not be introduced.
Are you sure your coverage-report can be trusted? Yes, you run 75 percent of your code during unit testing, but will these tests actually catch if you introduce a bug? By using a mutation testing-tool like Pitest you will be able to identify weak spots and you get an overview of how much of your code is actually asserted. This lightning talk will explain mutation testing, and it will demonstrate how to quickly get up and running with Pitest using maven.

After a quick overview of the upcoming lambda expressions in Java8, the main purpose of this talk is to show, with practical examples, how to use them effectively and how they can help to develop more concise and readable code.
Finally also Java, with its 8th major release, will have lambda expressions and then will allow to employ some functional techniques into its strongly object oriented paradigm. But why this decision has been taken, what will be its consequences, how will it change the way we write Java and, most important, how can we leverage it to develop more expressive, readable, reusable and effective software? After a quick introduction to the syntax of the new lambda expressions, the main purpose of this talk is to answer these questions, showing how functional programming can make us better Java developer and help to avoid or limit some bad habits inherited from our OOP backgroud, like the abuse of side effects, null references and exceptions in our code.

Of course, any Java programmer knows how to write a method. But is that really the case? Many programmers find they code more by habit — habits picked up from frameworks, IDE defaults and a random selection of blogs — than by reason. This talk tries to dissect some common habits with reason to reveal, well, how to write a method.
We all know how to write a method. We all know how to write a class. We all understand how to name a field. We all understand the practices we use, their deep rationale and their implications. We are perfectly rational, reasoned and unbiased about how we code and the practices we employ. Then again... perhaps not. It turns out that we pick up habits and practices without being aware of them, retrospectively creating justification and rationale for what we do, whether it is naming conventions, indentation, control flow, use of language features, commenting, class layout, etc. All too often many things that have been considered good practice are discouraged because of IDE defaults or memes and habits emerging from vocal developers. This session tries to take a more rational approach that allows you to evaluate and improve how you write methods. There is a good chance you won't agree with everything as many common Java habits are questioned and subjected to merciless reasoning.

How can JSF still be relevant in a world where Vaadin and Thin Server Architecture is on the rise? This presentation shows how new features in JSF 2.2 keep it relevant for a certain class of application that still dominates in the enterprise.
Now that JSF 2.2 has completed, this session will demonstrate the most important features in the context of a self-contained sample application. The features covered include: * HTML5 Friendly Markup * Faces Flows * Resource Library Contracts The attendee of this session will learn how JSF is still relevant in today's enterprise software stack. Specifically, they will learn why one would want to upgrade to JSF 2.2 rather than opting for a different architecture entirely.

Regular expression matching using callbacks. Efficient data structures. Benchmarking.
(note: this abstract is in even though I intend to make the talk itself in norwegian) This is about a toy project I have called "rmatch" https://github.com/la3lma/rmatch. It's probably useful for something, but mostly it's just something I had to write It's also a very nice regular expression matching library that makes it possible to look for many matching expression in the same input, each of the expressions are connected to their own callback function. This implementation is way more efficient than sequential matching for each of the regular expressions. Sequential matching will use time proportional to O(N) where N is the number of expressions being matched, but rmatch will use time proporsional to O(log N) which is obviously much better, in particular for large Ns. For both of these cases the time spent on running the callbacks will proportional to O(M) where M is the number of matches found. Rmatch is based on callbacks: You submit a trigger that gets called when some input is processed by the matcher. You can have any number of regular expressions in the single matcher (up to limits given by physical memory). During everyday testing several tens of thousand regular expressions are added and matched against. The matcher will match all the expressions in parallel and when a match is found for any given expression, it will try to make that match as long as possible before terminating the match and calling the callback. The underlying deterministic/nondeterministic automata implementation was a lot of fun to figure out, in fact it was so much fun to figure out that I became obsessed with making an implementation. In a nutshell it is all quite efficient since only the parts of the deterministic automata necessary to match for the actual input is created. If for instance the input contains no "a" characters, then there will be no "a" edges anywhere in the deterministic automata. Also, there is actually only one deterministic automaton that matches the union of all the regular expressions. These two tricks ensure that no more than one deterministic automaton is made, and no more nodes or edges are added to it than strictly necessary for matching the input actually given to it. The matching then becomes a simple matter of traversing a deterministic automaton, and since that is quite simple it's also very fast. I have some tests backing this claim up. In a nutshell: For very simple cases (matching a single but complex regular expression and then adding a single counter) rmatch is faster than awk for, but slower than java regular expressions. For more complex tasks involving different things happening for different regular expressions, e.g. incrementing a different counter for each regular expression, then rmatch compares favourably even with java regexps which btw are wicked fast.

Ever wanted to turn your heating on from your phone, monitor the temperature in your greenhouse maybe even control a water pump in your solar water heating system? I plan to share with you some simple but fun projects that will get you started with using an Arduino micro controller and kickstart your automated life style.
Ever wanted to turn your heating on from your phone, monitor the temperature in your greenhouse maybe even control a water pump in your solar water heating system? You can achieve all of this with one simple circuit board and a small amount of object oriented programing knowledge. I plan to share with you some simple but fun projects that will get you started with using an Arduino micro controller and kickstart your automated life style.
I am one of those guys who just loves playing with technology, if I can automate something using a computer, give someone a better user experience, play with something new or if someone tells me something just can’t be done I have to get stuck straight in. Up until a year ago I lived in Ireland where I was born, raised, went to school, went to University (when I woke up on time) and worked as much as I possibly could from the day I was legally allowed to. I come from quite a different background than most. I started out as a developer in a Coal Fired power station in Ireland where I wrote ladder logic for PLC’s that controlled different parts of the power station and then wrote software that operators could use to control the power station. I moved on to a company called Liberty IT who are responsible for writing all the software for the American insurance giant Liberty Mutual. I wrote in house and external web app’s for Liberty, some of which had to be written to incorporate with existing systems that were written in Java and still using Struts version 1.0 and some were brand new systems that we were allowed to use much more modern technology. Seeking new challenges I followed my Norwegian Girlfriend to Norway and I now work in Statkraft as a developer writing software for the energy management department. I am also a keen motorbike racer that loves being able to incorporate my software knowledge into my mechanical knowledge when building new race bikes each year for the upcoming season. I have written my own data logging software and my own quick shifter using the popular micro-controller known as an Arduino. I talked at Smidig 2012 about motivating teams and I hope you join me to here about the more technical side of my job

Java 8 will finally deliver us to the promised land of functional programming! We'll look at what new powers the new features such as Lambdas and Default Methods give us, and also where Java is still lacking compared to e.g. Scala and Clojure.
Java 8 will finally deliver us to the promised land of functional programming! So can we stop worrying now about learning Scala and Clojure and the other new kids on the block? We'll look at what new powers the new features such as Lambdas, Default Methods and Streams give us, as well as what Java is still lacking compared to other functional languages on the JVM.

New features in Cassandra 2.0 including lightweight transactions, virtual nodes, CQL (the Cassandra query language), as well as an updated look at performance.
Many people still think of Cassandra as a "key value store" or a "map of maps." Cassandra is a fast moving project, with over three years of intense development since it was contributed to Apache, and these early descriptions no longer do justice to Cassandra. This talk will cover new features in Cassandra 2.0 including lightweight transactions, virtual nodes, CQL (the Cassandra query language), as well as an updated look at performance.

This talk is about how the role and responsibility of a programmer will change. For software development not applicable for outsourcing, the future will require programmers that have the skill and the will to understand “The Big Picture”, being more like product developers and thinking customer development.
The computer can do much of what your logical and mathematical brain can do, but much faster. Programmers in Asia and Eastern-Europe can do much of what you can do, but at a much lower cost. Don´t worry, you won´t lose your job just yet. With the rapidly increasing number of fast growing new companies challenging existing companies, changing marketplaces and decreasing the lifespan of products and services, large organizations will need to reinvent it self more often. This kind of disruptive innovation contains no mathematical formulas for the computer to solve. No requirement specifications to be outsourced to Asia or Eastern-Europe. No way to predict, or buy, success. Lean Startup and other similar methods for new product development, will be the rescue for such large organizations when facing a potential “Kodak Moment”. Business decisions will become more data-driven, and we will need your help to capture data needed and to read it. Design decisions will be made by A/B-testing and other impact-oriented testing techniques, rather than some UX-expert or graphical designer dictating the best solution. This talk is about how the role and responsibility of a programmer will change. For software development not applicable for outsourcing, the future will require programmers that have the skill and the will to understand “The Big Picture”, being more like product developers and thinking customer development. During the 2008 Presidential campaign Obama was able to collect 70.000.000$ more funds as a result of programmers A/B-testing every new experiment.

JavaScript has come a long way in few years. As we no longer need to battle DOM differences we can focus on building our applications instead. Now, however, as more and more application logic move from the server to the client our main problem is that we need to unlearn our earlier DOM-centric approach to JavaScript. Tools such as Backbone and Angular help, but before we are able to use the effectively we have to change some of our neural pathways. In this talk I will look at a couple of patterns that will help you move away from jQuery spaghetti and get you started on a foundation for building large-scale JavaScript applications.
In recent years a number of libraries for building large JavaScript applications has appeared. As we no longer need to battle DOM differences between browsers we can finally focus on building highly interactive front-end applications instead. But before we can do a good job with these new libraries we need unlearn our previous DOM-centric approach to building JavaScript applications. In this presentation will take a look at what that means, and how we can build modular, testable and reusable code. We will also look at some of the key concepts in libraries such as Backbone.js and AngularJS, including two-way binding, dependency injection and templating. The ultimate goal is, in my mind, that we should treat our Javascript application as we treat our Java application. After this presentation you will have a much better idea of ​​what that means.
Kim is a senior consultant at Bekk Consulting in Oslo, Norway. He primarily works on large-scale JavaScript applications and he strongly believes that we should treat JavaScript as a real language when we use it to build large applications. In addition to creating Superhero.js and blogging about JavaScript, Kim is a frequent contributor to open source and a semi-frequent speaker at events both in Norway and abroad.

This lightning talk will go through why I think we tend to implement processes and structures that kill our creativity and takes the fun out of programming.
We keep organizing our programming into processes and structures that ensures that the fun is left out of the programming experience. In my opinion, programming SHOULD be fun, it should be opinionated and it should be a creative process. We need to stop optimizing for predictability and get back to the roots of what programming really is: Solving problems and issues in an innovative and engaging way!

Come steal several easy but effective workplace ideas from GitHub: a software company that defines success as a union of employee happiness and sustainable profits.
GitHub is an extremely unique software development organization, both in how it has evolved, how it functions, what it builds, and what it aspires to do for humankind at work. Learn how employee happiness and profits can and have gone hand in hand, and how the seeds of that are sown by having Hubot the robot do the dirty work, and having that dirty work done hundreds of times per day. I'll share some of the most useful culture secrets of work at GitHub, including live demonstrations of some of our open source and not-yet-open-sourced internal tools, continuous development practices, and skill-improvement vectors such as the successful rotating King of Developers role. All of the culture, process, daily work, and policies will be framed in the perspective of how they can be replicated at your place of employment for greater job satisfaction and more-successful-than-ever outcomes for your employer. We'll conclude with a brief ask-me-anything segment, with past experiences having touched on hiring, vacation, project direction, the explicit absence of managers, and employee trust.

The Smalltalk programming language demonstrates the power of object orientation and lambda expressions. How can this be applied in Java?
You have probably noticed the excitement regarding functional programming and the new lambda expression in Java 8. But did you know that this also brings Java back to its object-oriented roots? The Smalltalk programming language shows how virtually any task can be achieved through good old object orientation. Everything is built with the basic ingredients of objects, messages and blocks (lambda). Smalltalk uses lambda expressions for conditional processing, iteration and exception handling. We will look at some fascinating examples, and discuss if and how to apply them in Java. We Java programmers now find ourselves with a brand new lambda tool in our toolbox. Lets take the time to learn from the past about the power of object orientation and lambdas.

Learn how to test your web site styling and prevent unintentional layout changes.
Automated functional UI tests assert HTML markup and not the actual web page rendering. If a font-size or margin changes in your CSS unintentionally, or something else breaks visually, functional tests will still pass because the rendered HTML may still be the same. However, the web site may be rendered entirely differently. Join this session for an intro on how to automatically test website styling and detect unintentional layout changes with various tools and techniques. Learn how to use these tools to refactor your CSS safely.

Macros are a brand new feature of Scala 2.10. In the presentation I would like to explain why were they added to the language, show step by step how to write your own simple macro and show some libraries, which already use macros to implement functionalities, which were not possible before.
Macros [1] are one of the new features in Scala 2.10. So far they are marked as experimental, but I think nobody has doubts that they will stay there for good. Introducing macros was quite controversial, as Scala isn't a "lean" language already, but I think it was worth it. Macro is simply a Scala program, executed at compile-time, which manipulates the AST of our program. While we probably will mostly write macros when creating a library of a framework, rather than in day-to-day work (hopefully!), for sure it is good to know what are the mechanisms behind them. In the presentation, I would firstly like to show step-by-step how to write a simple macro and how does it work. In the second part I will present libraries, which already use macros (but without implementation details), such as ScalaMock [2], Expecty [3], Slick [4] or my own, MacWire [5].

This is a talk for those frustrated by monolithic software products and describes a set of tools and techniques that you can use to break up your products based on the Unix Philosophy of small and simple.
Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together” was accepted 40 years ago yet we have spent the last decade building monolithic applications, communicating via bloated middleware and with our fingers crossed that Moore’s Law keeps helping us out. There is a better way. Micro services. In this talk we will discover a consistent and reinforcing set of tools and practices rooted in the the Unix Philosophy of small and simple. Tiny applications, communicating via the web’s uniform interface with single responsibilities and installed as well behaved operating system services. So, are you sick of wading through tens of thousands of lines of code to make a simple one line change? Of all that XML? Come along and check out what the cools kids are up to (and the cooler grey beards). This is a talk about building micro-services using simple java tools

Database schema evolution is often performed ad-hoc: a quick statement here, a little script there. The result: confusion and uncertainty. Has this update already been applied on this instance? Should we apply this other script first? Is our application going to run against this database? No more! This is where database migration tools come to the rescue! We'll look at a popular open-source choice called Flyway. By the end of the session, you'll have a solid understanding of what it does, how it works and how to effectively integrate it into your project.

With so many JavaScript MVC libraries out there, how does a time constrained developer make a smart choice? In this survey, we'll compare and contrast some of today's most popular libraries.
Developers are flocking to client side frameworks and, as a result, there are more and more JavaScript libraries attempting to solve the rich internet application problem. In a space where new libraries seem to spring up weekly, what framework should you choose for your next project? While there is consensus around basic ideas like Model View Whatever, there are some strong philosophical differences amongst the various libraries. In this talk, we'll look at the similarities and the differences of some emerging JavaScript libraries discussing why you need to be aware of this rapidly evolving aspect of software development.

Traditional web development frameworks are changing. With an increase in popular frameworks for client-side web development such as Backbone, Ember or AngularJS, the role of the backed is limited to data processing and serving information. And that's exactly where it should be. In this session we're going to combine the power of concise JVM languages such as Kotlin, with front-end frameworks to create powerful and rich web applications. We'll see how we can drastically reduce the amount of code required and create a maintainable system.

Did you know that you can access and modify the complete AST of a Java program through the Pluggable Annotation Processing API? In this session, I hope to provide some inspiration by describing how this is done and by sharing lessons learned from building a generator feature (think yield) for Java.
Did you know that you can access and modify the complete AST of a Java program through the Pluggable Annotation Processing API? There are numerous projects that leverage this to add various interesting language features, such as implicitly typed variables. In this session, I will describe how this is done and share lessons learned from building a generator feature (think yield) for Java. I will touch upon subjects such as constraints imposed by compiler phases, AST rewriting, coding in unsupported API land and AST changes between Java versions, integration testing across Java versions, javac versus other compilers and IDE support. The purpose of the session is to inspire some fun Java hacking, and a fair amount of Java knowledge is assumed.

If it isn't worth maintaining, it isn't worth writing.
The process of software maintenance starts just after the very first bits of code have been written. Lets face it very few of us enjoy chasing bugs, reading tagliatelle code, finding inconsistencies in how things are built, fixing the same bug in 50 different places due to copy-paste-coding, not feeling confident in our own modifications due to sub-par tests and having none or broken documentation. As a software project grows, and time passes, it is very common for bugs to be harder to find, changes to be harder to make, and new features harder to integrate. Sounds painfully familiar? Don't worry, in this talk we'll explore ways of dealing with these issue before they even become a problem.

Bugs in production systems are typically communicated in stack traces. But why don't we communicate in unit tests?
This presentation discuss a concrete open source Java framework that allows production systems to communicate bugs as test cases. It will produce deterministic, sandboxable test cases having identical execution paths as the original run. Using the framework correctly will even make multi-threaded scenarios re-playable.

One line of code that changed the Web forever, and how to take advantage of it to build new and exciting solutions.
I have more than once been asked what I believe the impact of the emerging WebSocket standard would have on the Web, assuming we continue down the path that has already been laid out. The impact could be the same, or even more profound, as when we were first introduced to HTTP as a means to share static documents. Today, 6 years after inception, this new standard is rapidly maturing as the preferred choice deploying interactive live Web solutions. It is changing how we think about Web architecture and design, and how we can leverage this phenomenal communication fabric for new exciting solutions. In this session we will discuss the progress of the WebSocket standard, how to architect, build, and deploy real-world solutions, and what new exciting solutions we see at the horizon that is leveraging this new Web standard.

Jonas Jacobi is co-founder and CEO of Kaazing, a company recognized for its contribution to the creation of the WebSocket standard. He lives by two rules; 90% of life is showing up, and nothing is impossible (impossible things might just take a bit longer).

By taking a look at industry trends and standards with proven track records, developers and architects will gain insight on how to improve their ability to add value within an organization.
Developers are used to thinking in terms of code. Architects are used to thinking in terms of systems. By learning to think about information, both groups can build more and better value. Software is but a means to an end. We will learn from where the Web has been and where it is going. We will see that tools like REST, Machine Learning and Big Data are all interesting, but insufficient.

How to build an automatically scaled processing pipeline with Java, Amazon EC2 and S3.
Cloud computing vastly simplifies the process of launching new servers with various configurations. This presentation tells the story of how we at Comoyo used Amazon Web Services (EC2 and S3) to create our own Frankenstein monster, a video processing pipeline that splits the tasks across a mix of various operating systems and components. Processing nodes are launched automatically when needed, and shut themselves down when there's nothing to do, providing a system that easily handles large workloads, while requiring very little up-front investments and little to no costs when activity is low. While we used this for video processing, the approach presented can be used for any long-running tasks that require many different software components. Our architecture is based on plain Java and some Bash scripting, with coordination over JAX-RS interfaces in straight-forward HTTP.

Git is unsocial and destroys the team experience. Don't use it.
Are you using Subversion or CVS? That's great, whatever you do, don't migrate to Git! Git makes you work overtime, confuses developers with too many options, destroys the social interaction with your co-workers and much more. Git has unnecessary features like offline commits and cherry picking that nobody needs at his day job. Your code is the most important thing for your software development and you should use a mature technology for storing it. Let the kids play around with Git. In this ironic lightning talk I will give you 5 reasons, why you shouldn't use Git always with a twinkle in the eye. So create a new branch in SVN and come to my session while you checkout the branch.

In this presentation, the data will do most of the talk. Show up if you want to know why choosing Java is a business risk, or why the most important reason for choosing Scala or Clojure is non-technical.
For software companies in a tight employment market like the one in Norway, most technical advantages are dwarfed by one concern: Access to good developers. It clearly doesn't matter what kinds of technical advantages a new language can bring, if you can't hire any developers to work with it. On the flip side, if you can bring great developers to your project, you're probably in good shape no matter what language you have chosen. Starting with a list of the 23 most popular programming languages, I have investigated the job market and surveyed more than 100 developers in Norway. Based on this insight, my analysis seeks to answer important questions about developer preferences and their accordance with available positions in the market. For instance, it turns out that although Java is the most widely known language, it is a risky choice for businesses. On the other hand, organisations that base their projects on Scala or Clojure should be optimistic about their future. If businesses took this advice to heart, the science of software development would progress, and developers and managers everywhere would be happier.

How we used BackboneJS and other Javascript tools to create a single page Javascript frontend against a Spring/Java backend for the new National Health Portal. Presentation will be held in norwegian.
Javascript libraries and client-side MV* frameworks like BackboneJS are very popular and much discussed these days, but Java is not usually the typical choice of backend platform for web-applications that employ these tools. In this talk I will share our experiences after integrating a modern frontend-stack with a Java-backend, shining light on what the challenges were and how we resolved them. Kjernejournal is a new initiative by the Norwegian Directorate of Health to gather important health information from all (non-reserving) citizens in a common health-record system to which all authorized health personell has access - anywhere, anytime, with the ultimate goal to save lives through increased information sharing. The product is a web portal, and naturally the demands of security, but also of responsiveness and usability are very high.

He is very focused on choosing the right technical approach when it comes to GUI implementation - to meet not only the demands but also the wishes of the UX/designer-team, making no compromises on usability and speed but still delivering on time and budget.

Learn how to build and run a system that gets smarter over time by learning from data. If you already took a class in machine learning this talk will show you how to translate those skills into a working system. If you don’t know any machine learning you will get a gentle introduction and gain a better understanding for how the data-driven sausage is made.
This talk will teach you what goes into building and running a machine learning system, as seen from a Java developer’s perspective. This will prepare you for the next phase of Big Data, where data is used not just for informing decisions but to drive system behavior. Instead of going into the details of algorithms we will discuss the overall system and project lifecycle (modeling, training, serving, re-training). Along the way you will get practical tips and advice about useful tools, some that you already know and some you probably haven’t heard of. Lastly you will get some tips for how can start playing around with this stuff even if nobody is paying you for it.

Distributed Consensus is everywhere! Even if not obvious at first, most apps nowadays are distributed systems, and these sometimes have to "agree on a value", this is where consensus algorithms come in. In this session we'll look at the general problem and solve a few example cases using the RAFT algorithm implemented using Akka's Actor and Cluster modules.
The world of programming is leaning more and more towards distributed apps. Even if think you're not knowingly developing "an distributed app", in fact you probably are - because of external dependencies on other providers services. In the world of Distributed Programming the problem of making sure that multiple servers "see the same value" has been known for a long time, and there are quite a few ways to solve it. In this session we'll talk why you should care about consensus, where to apply it (or where it is applied for you by a database or middleware!) and how one would go about implementing a distributed consensus protocol by looking at the RAFT consensus algorithm and implement it using Akka Clustering.

Learn about the benefits of adopting functional programming principles in your software development projects. We'll touch on issues such as reuse, reduced complexity, testing, performance and more!
There's a lot of buzz about Functional Programming. Even Java has gotten support with the release of Java 8! Why should we as developers, architects or project managers care? Come learn about some of the benefits you can get by incorporating aspects of functional programming in your project. We'll touch on issues such as reuse, reduced complexity, improved testability, expressiveness, bugs, performance and more!
Fredrik works as a software developer and consultant at Iterate. His main interest currently is functional programming and in particluar how to apply this in his daily job as a Java developer. He's held training courses in Scala and dabbled in Clojure, and likes to speak at conferences.

The first thing you learn in programmer's kindergarten: "Don't reinvent the wheel". The second thing you learn is: "Make wheels for your friends". In this talk we examine when this is good advice and when it is bad and how to get the most bang for your reuse buck.
If need the same functionality in two projects, you should reuse code between them, right? Or should you? For as long as there has been a profession of software engineering, we have tried to achieve more reuse. But reuse has both a benefit and a cost. Too often, the cost is forgotten. In this talk, I examine the economics of reuse. True story: One of the earliest projects to embrace object-oriented programming in the 1990s did so with the goal of maximizing reuse. The team responsible for creating the company wide framework used the following formula for calculating the value of their work: [Value of reuse] = [numbers of uses of framework] * [value of the framework to reusers] – [cost of developing the framework] This formula is obviously correct, but this is where they went horribly wrong: The organization said [value of framework to reusers] = [cost of developing framework]. In other words: The more expensive it was to create, the more valuable it was to use. In this talk, I will expand on the formula for the value of reuse, I will examine the difference between tactical and strategic reuse and I will point to factors that will make reuse harder or easier.

Have you ever wondered how your Java code turns into byte codes? Lets have a look under the hood of the OpenJDK java compiler! You will find that it is surprisingly easy to understand and even make modifications. As an exercise we will add support for goto statements in Java: we will show you how to write, compile and debug Java code with goto statements! Finally, we demonstrate how a small modification would allow you to compile lambda statements for older JVMs. For the daring: goto presentation;
As Java developers we can learn a lot by studying the compiler. It is very interesting to see what happens to our code on the way to become byte codes. Contrary to what you may believe, the compiler is in fact surprisingly easy to understand. The compilation process is intuitive, with clearly defined stages: lexing, parsing, attribution, flow analysis, desugaring and finally byte code generation. Each step will be presented with familiar examples that Java developers experience in their everyday work. Adding goto syntax follows the same step-by-step process, hooking into the relevant stages along the way. The changes can be done incrementally with supporting unit tests to assert the sanity of the compiler. The example is particularly attractive and educational, as all the required components are readily part of the language: reserved goto word, labeled statements and byte code. A radical change to the language can therefore be achieved with only a tiny effort. This shows how extensible the Java language and virtual machine can be. Compilation of lambda statements is a particularly interesting new feature. We will look into how this is solved by the compiler, and play with a small naive change to also target earlier releases of the JVM. Let us demystify the compiler and in a playful manner see what we can do with it!

Are you afraid? Worried the service you're calling will be down? Or too slow? Or return the wrong value? You should be. But that's no reason to make your own code more complex and less stable. Fear, as we all know, leads to the dark side, but it also leads to large and complex enterprise systems. We need to keep calm and solve the right problem.
It's no secret that there is a lot of shitty code out there. Lots of the services we rely on for our applications are unstable or buggy or both. So how should we handle this? We don't want our applications to fail. It is tempting to try to fix the bad situation in our own code. By creating our own services to act as intermediaries, by adding asynchronous queues, and try catches galore. What is the result? Not only do we rely on an external service that is unstable, now OUR code is far more complex and therefore more unstable as well. Some times we have no choice in the matter, but often we do. More often than you'd think. We need to solve the right problem - fix the service that is unstable in the first place. There are many things we can do to help. Although it might mean interaction with other human beings. I know. It sucks, but we can do it. It's the right thing to do.

Vaadin is the shortest way for pure Java programmers with few front-end skills to quickly create nice-looking and robust web applications running on the JVM.
Today is all about those fancy client frameworks and stuff. However, this means that you and your team have as many front-end skills as back-end skills, or that there are two different teams that need to integrate their code together. The first case is rare, the second costly. Come discover Vaadin, the no-fluff just-stuff Java web framework. You code only in Java, compile to bytecode and thus can integrate easily with Spring, CDI, JDBC, JPA, ... Plus you get true Object Oriented Programming, Singe-Page paradigm, an Event-Driven abstraction over the HTTP request response model, Server Push and much much more. If you don't know about Vaadin, now is the time! Important: the allocated time is limited, so that in order to be as efficient as possible, attendees are expected to prepare their environment for the workshop in advance. First, get Java (preferably 8), Maven and your IDE of choice (Eclipse, IntelliJ or NetBeans). There's a dedicated Github project page: https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/. Clone the repository and checkout tag v7.2-1. Then, import the project into your IDE, run mvn package and you should be set.

Does setting up servers and deploying Java Apps have to be this complex? What if you could start over and radically simplify all this? What if, within seconds, and with a single command, you could wrap your application into the bare minimal machine required to run it? This talk challenges the status quo and proposes a radical rethinking of Java App deployment. It takes Continuous Delivery and the Cloud up to 11.
Java App deployment is a complex and time-consuming process. It requires OS installers, package management tools, configuration recipes, install and deployment scripts, server tuning, hardening and more. But... Is this really necessary? Are we trapped in a mindset of doing things this way just because that's how they've always done? What if you could start over and radically simplify all this? What if, within seconds, and with a single command, you could wrap your application into the bare minimal machine required to run it? What if this machine could then run unchanged on your workstation and in the cloud? This talk challenges the status quo and proposes a radical rethinking of Java App deployment. If you believe in simplicity and efficiency over complexity and brute force; if you aren't afraid to look forward with fresh thinking, buckle up: this talk is for you. It takes Continuous Delivery and the Cloud up to 11. Live demo included.

Reviews are a powerful tool for building quality software, but it can sometimes be difficult to convince your team to use them. In this presentation we’ll look at the research behind reviews, the benefits they can provide, and some best practices for using them effectively. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to make informed decisions about - and strong arguments for - using reviews on your projects.
Software development is a young (some would say immature) profession, and a lot of what we do as software developers is guided by anecdotes, intuition, and received wisdom. The topic of reviews, however, is a bit different, and we’ve actually got a substantial body of research that tells us something important: reviews improve quality, reduce delivery time, and save money without slowing development teams down. Given what we know about the efficacy of reviews, it would be surprising to still find development organizations today that don’t use them. Yet we do. In this talk I’ll present some of what we know about reviews. We’ll look at questions like: How long should a review be? What kinds of artifacts can be usefully reviewed? How is the time spent in reviews accounted for in terms of quality or ROI? Some of the answers to these questions can be very eye-opening! Along with the “harder” economic and software-oriented benefits of reviews, I’ll also spend some time looking at some of the social and team-oriented improvements they can provide. All of these elements build upon one another, of course, so it’s useful to have high-level or holistic sense of what reviews can do for your organization. Ultimately, my goal is to convince you that reviews probably should be part of your everyday development practices and to help you find the best ways to use them.

A walk through of the G1 garbage collector in HotSpot. Discussing how it works and how it compares to other garbage collectors.
The G1 collector takes a slightly different approach to garbage collection than the other collectors in HotSpot. At the same time it plays along with many of the concept introduced by the other garbage collectors. This talk will give a quick overview of the most commonly used garbage collectors in HotSpot and then go into detail about the G1 collector. The more flexible architecture of G1 provides opportunities for dynamic adoption as well as tuning that the other GCs do not support. We will learn what is common among the GCs, what is different with G1 and some insights into how to tune G1.

How many times have been told how functional programming is so much better than imperative, and then being presented with a functional approach to calculating a fibonacci sequence, leaving you wondering how that can be even remotely useful when working in real world applications? Yep, we’ve all been there. It seems that every time someone wants to explain functional programming to us, it’s around how to solve some mathematical problem. But how does that provide us value? How do we deal with things like grouping functionality, loose coupling and consequently dependency injection? Join this journey where we’ll look at code we usually write when developing business applications and how to refactor this using functional paradigms, and more importantly, see if these provide us with any value.

Hystrix is a great library that helps you to write resilient applications. This session will give you a head start into integrating Hystrix into your own application.
Availability is the alpha and omega in production, preferable 24x7, as few outages as possible. But to get there, it is not sufficient to rely solely on the fault tolerance mechanisms built into the infrastructure level. Instead you explicitly need to code the required resilience into your application. An especially tricky challenge is to make sure that a component does not get blocked due to another non-responsive component. We all know it just too well: the web server stands still because the database does not respond - and alike. Exactly this problem gets addressed by Hystrix, an OpenSource library by Netflix. In this session you will understand, what Hystrix does, and based on concrete code examples you will learn how to make your application more resilient easily using Hystrix - no more non-responsive applications!

The Java Management Extensions (JMX) are old but omnipresent in every JVM. Unfortunately it is surprisingly hard to access the exposed information remotely, especially for non-Java clients. Jolokia is an open source HTTP bridge which translates JMX calls to JSON and vice versa.
After pointing out the problems with JMX, we will see how Jolokia can solve these. Additional features like bulk requests or fine grained security policies are explained. The ecosystem around Jolokia like client libraries and tooling are presented as well as the various Jolokia agents available. At the end of the talk you will have a good understanding what Jolokia is and which problems it solves.

A fast-paced view of how graph data (and Neo4j) can supercharge data analytics.
In this talk we'll explore powerful analytic techniques for graph data. Firstly we'll discover some of the innate properties of (social) graphs from fields like anthropology and sociology. By understanding the forces and tensions within the graph structure and applying some graph theory, we'll be able to predict how the graph will evolve over time. To test just how powerful and accurate graph theory is, we'll also be able to (retrospectively) predict World War 1 based on a social graph and a few simple mechanical rules.Then we'll see how graph matching can be used to extract online business intelligence (for powerful retail recommendations). In turn we'll apply these powerful techniques to modelling domains in Neo4j (a graph database) and show how Neo4j can be used to drive business intelligence. Don't worry, there won't be much maths :-)

It's awkward to perform science experiments on developers, so let's simulate them instead!
In 1968 Melvin Conway pointed out a seemingly inevitable symmetry between organisations and the software systems they construct. Organisations today are more fluid than 40 years ago, with short developer tenure, and frequent migration of individuals between projects and employers. In this slot we’ll examine - and perhaps collect - data on the tenure and productivity of programmers and use this to gain insight into codebases, by simulating their growth with simple stochastic models. From such models, we can make important predictions about the maintainability and long-term viability of software systems, with implications for how we approach software design, documentation and how we assemble teams.

There are many mechanisms for storing and processing a collection of data sets so large and complex that we collectively refer to it as Big Data. Using live demos and code we'll show you how simple yet well-known and very powerful techniques can help you optimize data Capture, Storage and Access.
There are many mechanisms for storing and processing a collection of data sets so large and complex that we collectively refer to it as Big Data. From No SQL data stores to the Distributed File Systems and Computation engines to columnar stores to flat files - its all about capture, storage, analysis, searches etc. We want it all and we want it fast and traditional data processing applications can no longer support our demands. And while technologies such as Hadoop and its ecosystem derivatives paved an initial path to solving Big Data problems the approaches and assumptions they are built on starting to show its limitations one could only overcome by radically changing the way we think about storing and accessing data in general. In the end it’s all about I/O and how to make it more efficient. The following is the small sub-set of questions that will help set the scope and drive this presentation. - How to deal with capturing high data volumes (1+ million events per/sec). - How to store and organize the data? Unstructured doesn't mean un-organized - Compress, encode or pack? What are the differences, pros and cons? - Data-Type patterns. What does it mean? How to spot them during data capture and what are the benefits? - Loss of analytical data available (for free) during the capture. What, Why, the implications and how to deal with them? - Is disk speed the limit for how fast the data can be captured/accessed? - Role of CPU/RAM in I/O intensive environments and can they play a role? In the end using live demos and code we'll show you how simple yet well known and very powerful techniques can help you optimize: - CAPTURE of data in high volumes environments (1+ million events per/sec) - STORAGE of captured data, making it much smaller (10:1 to 20:1), thus more efficient for general read/write. - ACCESS of stored data based on optimization techniques used during its capture and storage, further increasing I/O read speeds when accessing such data (e.g., search 1B records in just few seconds - single laptop).

You have probably heard about the now infamous digital currency Bitcoin. Involved in crime and major heists of millions of dollars. Are these currencies just a ponzi scheme? Is it as unsafe to use as it seems in the media? This talk will look at how two very different kinds of crypto currencies and payment systems work: Bitcoin and Ripple.
Bitcoin was created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto just 6 years ago. The market value of all bitcoins today is over 10 billion dollars. It is not just a geek curiosity anymore. This talk will not deal with investing or using bitcoins but about how distributed digital currencies work. Concepts explored include bitcoin transactions, the block chain, ripple trust lines etc.

Search algorithms mimicking various natural phenomena provide an elegant solution to the optimization problems in software engineering. Based on our experience of applying search algorithms in several industries, this task will present results, experiences, and lessons learnt while applying search algorithms to various industrial problems including optimal requirements allocation, optimal test data generation, and test optimization/selection.
Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an emerging field that has brought excellent results in the recent years for solving complex industrial problems requiring optimization. At the core of the SBSE are the search algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithms mimicking natural selection process) that can efficiently find optimal solutions to the problems that have large complex search spaces. Typical examples of such problems in software engineering include: optimal allocation of requirements, optimal architecture design, test case generation, and test optimization. The talk will provide our experience of using search algorithms for solving the following problems in several companies in the last several years: 1) Optimal test case/test data generation; 2) Optimal requirements allocation; 3) Test optimization. The results will be presented in addition to a set of guidelines for the practitioners to apply search algorithms in their particular context.

Writing clean, testable JavaScript can be a daunting task for front-end developers. Many find it difficult to get into and thus discard it. Test automation is an essential part of modern web applications, especially when it comes to maintainability. In this talk, I show how easy and straightforward testable JavaScript code can be written.
Very often we see untested front-end code going into production, merely depending on manual human testing. The problem is, the human error factor plays a role here, and as humans we often tend to make mistakes. Bearing that in mind, not having test automation on JavaScript code can lead to trouble. Test automation is an essential part of modern web applications, especially when it comes to maintainability. In this talk, I show how easy and straightforward testable JavaScript code can be written. Practicing test driven development and combining the power of AngularJS and TypeScript. With the use of tools such as Jasmine, Karma test runner and code coverage. And finally automating the whole process with TeamCity. After the talk, you'll know how to: - Practice test driven development with JavaScript - Combine AngularJS with TypeScript - Use AngularJS' test design capabilities - Use JavaScript testing tools; Jasmine and Karma - Automate testing with TeamCity

Many applications are built with the same architectural style: a layered architecture with (more often than not) an anaemic domain model. While easy to set up, this architectural style doesn't help us deal with growing complexity or heavy non-functional requirements. In this presentation, Allard will introduce CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation) and Axon Framework. CQRS is an architectural pattern that helps build scalable and maintainable software, by applying a few very simple, yet powerful, principles. Axon is a framework that simplifies the implementation of CQRS based architectures on the JVM.
The web has changed drastically the last few years. The browser is becoming the de-facto application platform for online cooperation. To accommodate this, applications need to be able to scale up and down dynamically as the number of users fluctuates. While a few years ago planned downtime was acceptable, nowadays most applications need close-to-100% uptime. Furthermore, the continuous need to innovate stresses the importance of extensibility and maintainability of applications. In this presentation, Allard will show how CQRS promotes the decoupling of components that change an application's state (the commands) from the components that provide information about the current state (the queries). This architectural approach makes it easier to handle increasing complexity and ensure the application's ability to scale. You will also see how CQRS can help build high performance applications and provide business value by storing valuable information about the application's history. Finally, we will cover how the Event Driven aspect of CQRS allows for decoupling of components, keeping applications extensible without compromising maintainability. The presentation covers the theoretical background of CQRS, but will mostly focus on the practical aspects, including code. You will learn how your applications can benefit by applying some very simple principles to your architecture.
Allard Buijze is software architect at Trifork, which delivers software development, consultancy and training services to both national and international organizations. As an architect, he is responsible for the technical choices in his projects and investigates technologies for their potential in the diversity of projects Trifork does. For the last decade, he has been developing and designing enterprise applications for both large-scale and smaller projects. His focus has always been on clean application design, maintainability and performance. The training of co-developers is a very important part thereof. Allard has given several trainings in the areas of scalable architectures, test driven development, application design and clean coding. He strongly believes that good craftsmanship can only be achieved through continuous and intensive exchange of experience with others. He is also a regular speaker on meetups and conferences, such as J-Fall, Jazoon, QCon and Goto. The last years, he has been investigating and applying CQRS to a number of projects. As a result, he created the Axon Framework, an open source Java framework that helps developers create scalable and extensible applications by providing the building blocks that CQRS based infrastructures typically require. Axon has a growing community and has already been successfully introduced in several high-profile projects around the world.

A large change is afoot in software development. Baby steps have lead the way noted by continuous delivery efforts, virtual machines and service oriented architecture. Leading a cloud R&D team, It is clear the next steps in cloud development are through virtualized applications and application containers (not virtual machines). This movement has already started and is being used at Docker, Inc., twitter, foursquare, AirBnb and Baidu just to name a few.
This session will cover the future of cloud development using docker and mesos and how it will create a commoditized cloud solution and how it will change software development moving forward. DevOps and the whole continuous delivery pipeline will be affected from the commit stage forward. LXC and containerization is the secret ingredient to Linux added by Google in 2008. LXC have been difficult and tedious to configure until Docker arrived on the scene last year. Docker simplifies the containerization of applications and provides git-like capabilities at the service level of the CD pipeline. The remaining missing ingredient to a distributed software solution is a distributed operating system, which is solved by Apache Mesos. Mesos provides management and fault tolerance to big data solutions such as Hadoop and application services such as running Tomcat web service.

How do you design an open web programming language that is modern, productive, fast, and that can be translated to efficient JavaScript? That were the challenges we faced when starting the Dart project.
The design of a programming language is often bound by several factors: legacy, simplicity, backwards compatibility, and performance. This talk will discuss some of the tough language design choices we made long with the explanations how we ended up with the current design. At the end, I hope the audience will agree that we make the right design decisions.
Lars Bak is a software engineer at Google, co-designer of the Dart programming language, and he has spent the last 28 years implementing object-oriented programming languages. Some of the projects from his past: Beta, Self, Strongtalk, Hotspot, Monty, OOVM, V8, and Dart.

Releasing an open source project while maintaining a shipping product is hard! Different behaviors, attitudes and actions can help or hinder your cause; and they are not always obvious.
The Blueflood distributed metrics engine was released as open source software by Rackspace in August 2012. In the succeeding months the team had to strike a manageable balance between the challenges of growing a community, being good open source stewards, and maintaining a shipping product for Rackspace. Find out what worked, what did not work, and the lessons that can be applied as you endeavor to take your project out into the open. In this presentation you will learn about strategies for releasing open source products, pitfalls to avoid, and the potential benefits of moving more of your development out in the open. We have also made a few realizations about the community growing up around metrics. It is still young, and there are problems that come with that youth. I'll talk about some things we can do to make a better software ecosystem.

Take a deep dive into distributed real-time stream processing and be inspired by a technology which allows a new set of applications
Dominated by batch oriented Hadoop-based Map/Reduce implementations for 3 to 5 years, lately we saw a switch towards real-time stream processing in Big Data. Frameworks like Spark Streaming, Shark and Samza allowed a huge step forward into a more ad hoc based future of data analytics. Developed to serve true problems in specific environments these frameworks are not fully sufficient for our problem domain. Therefore we decided to design and implement our own framework with bonds from existing projects. At its core heart we designed the architecture to serve ad hoc requests like timed sample data extraction, pattern recognition or data enrichment without the need to deploy heavyweight artifacts right before process execution. This talk will present the architecture specification, discuss the requirements imposed by our (non-)technical departments that led to design decisions, describe the differences towards existing frameworks, give a forecast on our roadmap and show you the code base along with a short (live coding) example implementing & running a simple service. Although we are currently based on akka.io (for message/stream processing), Kafka (for message passing) and Zookeeper (for component configuration) knowledge towards these frameworks is not required to follow this talk. As we believe in the community, we plan to release project results and go open source. So, drop by and be inspired what's in store.

Larger and more complex systems calls for new solutions. Splitting the larger systems into smaller modules helps us reason about them in isolation, but leads to cross-module dependencies both for services and shared data. Managing these dependencies, in particular in a development environment, is hard, and gets harder by the number of modules. Virtualization and automation has taken us part of the way but it was Docker that finally helped us with some of the last wrinkles. This talk will show how the use of Docker can help streamline your development, versioning components and data, setting up dependencies and deployment to production.
The systems we develop at growing larger by the day, and the problems we solve keep getting more complex. One way we deal with both size and complexity is to divide our systems into smaller modules or components that we can reason about independently and develop in relative isolation. However, this comes at the cost of dependencies between these components when they interact, using data or services provided by another component. Setting up a streamlined development environment in this setting has become a major challenge. One solution is to use virtualization and tools like Puppet and Vagrant to automatically set up new virtual machines as needed. Virtualization comes with its own set of challenges, and only get you part of the way. The last year, Docker (http://docker.io) has joined the field as a fresh breath, putting focus on lightweight containerization and true portability instead of virtualization. This talk will showcase using Docker to iron out the some of the wrinkles in our environment using modules and partly shared data as an example, and how we use Docker in our day-to-day development cycle.

But how much reason supports the rituals and mantras often repeated as coding guidelines? It turns out that the advice often fails, even for the novices they are intended to guide. Let's reason through these rather than accept them as unquestioned habits.
How many asserts should a test case have or not have? How much work should a constructor (not) do? What mantra guides test-first programming? How do you name your classes and other identifiers? How do you lay out your code? These questions and others have standard answers based on received and repeated mantras, practices that are communicated in good faith to be passed on as habits. But how much reason supports these assertions? It turns out that the advice often fails, even for the novices they are intended to guide. This talk has little respect for ritual and tradition and takes no prisoners: What actually makes sense and what doesn't when it comes to matters of practice? What guidelines offer the greatest effect and the greatest learning?

"Single Page Applications", or AngularJS in particular, aren't always the answer. Avoid the technology trap - choose the right tools for the job by thoroughly considering *what* the product you are making should be doing, and *not how*.
We've got so many choices to make when deciding how to build our solutions. We already have an extensive repertoire of tools and technologies that we've been using for years. And on the other hand, the web development industry is moving so fast it seems that every year, there is a new kid on the block that promises fulfill all our architecture wishes. The pace of the industry and the breadth of options make these choices non-trivial. Getting them right requires thorough understanding of (i.e. experience with) the pros and cons of the different options, and an educated guess is often the best we can hope for due to time and money constraints. Case in point: Frontend solutions for webapps. What's in it for you? Some hard-earned advice on what to keep in mind when planning new projects Some up-to-date insight into the frontend architecture options This talk is about avoiding the "hammer first"-principle and how to choose tools & technologies when making architectural decisions, with a focus on web apps.

Solving problems only 2% of population can solve made easy.
Ever heard of Zebra Puzzles? Those logical puzzles that are claimed to be invented by Albert Einstein as a little boy? Those that are based on simple logical facts and go something like this: “The Brit lives in the Red house. The Swede keeps dogs as pets. The Dane drinks tea… Who owns the zebra?” Some claim that only 2% of the population can solve it. However, with the help of semantic technologies we can solve it in (almost) no time. Of course you have to know RDF, OWL, Jena, reasoning, inference... The good news are that we want to teach you all that in this session. We will start with introducing the puzzle and the toolbox for solving it. We will build a semantic representation of the puzzle (basically, a graph!), programmatically add some inferred facts and reason and solve the puzzle. Suddenly solving puzzles is a piece of cake for the other 98%. p.s. Come with your “We are the 98%” banners ready. :-) p.p.s. This is a hands-on workshop, so bring along your super computer. Preferably with Git, Maven, Java, and your favorite IDE installed and ready.

The famous "Java Puzzlers" made it clear that there are quite a few cases when it’s rather difficult to answer the question "what does this code do?" (our intuition deceives us). In this talk we are going to rewrite some of the code snippets to Kotlin and discuss what can be fixed in a new JVM language, what cannot be fixed and whether it really matters =).
The famous "Java Puzzlers" book (as well as series of talks) revealed several cases when it's quite a challenge to guess correctly the behaviour of the code. While some are JVM-related, most of those cases have roots in Java language and libraries design. For each puzzler it's interesting whether it could be fixed in "an ideal world" (without backward compatibility constraints). In some ways a new JVM language provides an opportunity to study it. In this talk we are going to look at several traditional Java "puzzlers" and try to rewrite them to Kotlin.

What is it that makes some programmers more productive than others? As programmers, our professional work is that of solving puzzles. We may be solving different problems, but in my experience, the only way to solve a problem is to through feedback. In this talk, I will examine how to accelerate your feedback loop. I will show practical examples of how to solve both theoretical and practical problems by starting with a small system that solves part of the problem and expanding from there.
"A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make work" "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked" To become more effective, you must find a smaller problem to solve _and_ maintain your ability to change the system to stay flexible and good while solving the full problem. I will show how to solve three problems with this philosophy: * A simple and theoretical problem, solved with pure, old-school test-driven development * A demanding user interface problem, solved with outside-in solution approach * A technically demanding problem, solved with a "shallow, then deep" solution approach All these approaches have in common that I quickly solve _something_ and then evolve my solution through safe steps.

The tight platform coupling found in most common web publishing systems is a potential bottleneck for enterprise level availability requirements in large web properties. Using a separated publishing architecture with an enterprise CMS decoupled from its web servers can provide a range of advantages including the potential for extremely high availability and scalability.
While your business might have a non-religious attitude to technology platforms in general, many common web CMSes will limit you to using their preferred platform throughout your publishing architecture, and while it might be a good tool for the editorial staff this platform might not be the best choice for your organization overall or to provide the needed flexibility in regards to availability or scalability. Using a loosely coupled CMS with a multi-platform architecture allows you to avoid such problems however. One option is the enterprise experience manager SDL Tridion which has a .NET based CMS for content editors but allow for publishing the dynamic web pages created through an application server of choice. This architecture provide many advantages such as the independent availability of the CMS and the web properties it handles, as well as being able to use open source java solutions for clustering while having an easy-to-use .NET-based user interface for content editors. This talk will give an overview of some benefits gained by such a combination of technology platforms by detailing the systems architecture for a major Norwegian web property as an example.

Lambdas and streams are more than just a more elegant way to express the same functionality. One of the major enhancements is that the underlying implementation of the stream API may process streams in parallel. This enables developers to use modern multi core processors efficiently with very little programming overhead. This talk shows how to use parallel streams to improve performance of a classical JEE server application.
Lambda expressions and streams are among the most important new features in Java 8. In many cases, lambda expressions enable the developer to write more concise and expressive code than with previous Java versions. Streams are a new API for applying lambda expressions to traditional data structures, like ArrayList and HashMap. However, the combination of lambdas and streams is more than just an elegant way to express the same functionality. One of the major enhancements is the ability to process streams in parallel. Parallel stream processing enables developers to use modern multi core processors efficiently with very little programming overhead. This talk presents Java 8 lambdas and streams, with a special focus on the parallelization features: * How can we use the parallelization features of the new standard library? * How can we implement our own data structures to support parallel processing? * What are the use cases for parallel stream processing, and when is parallel processing not feasible? * What are the technologies supporting parallel stream processing under the hood? These topics will be exemplified in a classical JEE server application.

Working as a penetration tester specializing in Web-application security I have seen secure code and insecure code. I have worked with developers with specific implementation problems, project managers on building security into applications and company managers regarding information security strategy. These collective experiences and some of the most important and common areas in web-applications where vulnerabilities arise will be the main focus of this talk.
The growing focus on securing our critical infrastructure and business critical applications has thrust the field of penetration testing into the limelight. Being more than one-time testing, it has now become an integral part of many organizations quality assurance programs, internal audits, strategic planning and among the key selling points in new and existing applications. This has put the security consultant and penetration tester in a role as the information security conduit between the development team as well as the board of directors and management. Constantly switching focus between code- and implementation level advice for developers up to security strategy and development lifecycle at the managerial level. This has provided a unique view of organizations fighting to maintain focus on information security all the while doing business in a tough marketplace. We will present experiences from working in the field of penetration testing, from encountering suppliers and clients to working with management and developers that are trying to provide the safest possible solution. All while fighting to maintain budget, tight deadlines and their own fear of security breaches. We want to show developers what vulnerabilities that are commonly found in key features of their web-application, some of the biggest security concerns that are usually forgotten when implementing Authentication and Session handling and discuss how to build inn security features from the beginning. There will be focus on the processes, code examples, functionality examples and how to detect these types of vulnerabilities in your own application. We will give an insight into the questions and overall strategies that we have encountered during our careers.

Estimates, we're bad at it. Really bad. Yet we continue to do it. Why don't we accept the fact that it's hard to predict anything, especially the future, and deal with it? #NoEstimates is a way to do deal with it: don't estimate, just count the number of work items on your list. Sounds simple, but does it work in real life?
The #NoEstimates movement claims that it can give better predictions on the time of completion of a project by not doing any estimates, but rather counting and tracking the number of work items on your list. This talk will give you a short introduction to how that works in practice, and some of its advantages. But be cautious: #NoEstimates doesn't solve everything, and has some drawbacks that we'll discuss too.

Before the Web, clients connected to back-end servers without compromises. As the Web came along with HTTP, we had to give up some of the power of our connectivity. With the evolving open Web communications standards, now we have a unique opportunity to move on from a request-response based REST world to a true, event-driven architecture. Learn what it takes to connect physical devices, such as Arduino and the Rasberry Pi to collect sensor data, or control physical devices over the Web.
Commercial aviation's biggest challenge when things go wrong is that flight data is stuck on the plane inside the black box. Until the black box is recovered, we barely know anything about what went wrong. This presentation offers detailed insights into how IoT and modern Web communications concepts have the power to change all this. If you're a maker, you will learn about "flight sensors" attached and controlled by Arduino, data transmitted over long range WiFi as well as satellite networks. If interested in real-time Web communications, you'll learn about a highly secure WebSocket implementation with extreme scale, publishing flight data to tablets and laptops used as monitoring dashboard. If protocol layering, enterprise messaging, or JMS is your thing, this talk is for you. Code samples and plenty of interactive live demos (with Things) add color to the talk.

Bring your continuous delivery pipeline to the next level with automated geb tests and a groovy domain specific language to create test data!
Creating automated browser tests is challenging, especially in those fast, asynchronous times. But fortunately we got plenty of tools to tackle the complexity and to write robust tests. With geb, the browser automation tool for groovy, you are able to write acceptance tests in a fancy way. You got a powerful page concept to avoid redundancy, full traversing support of the underlying web driver, support for asynchronous operations and the full groovy syntax goodness. But even with a good automation tool you still need to setup proper test data in your database for your tests. Groovy to the rescue! Say goodbye to boring sql scripts or confusing xml files. Use groovy features instead, write an expressive domain specific language and let the rest handle spring for you! In this talk I will present geb tests in action and show how easily complex test data could be created with groovy.

Continuous Delivery and architecture intersect in interesting ways, ranging from operational concerns for deployment pipelines to the ability to evolve your architecture over time.
Continuous Delivery is a process for automating the production readiness of your application every time a change occurs – to code, infrastructure, or configuration. It turns out that some architectures and practices yield code that works better in this environment. This session takes a deep dive into the intersection of the architect role and the engineering practices in Continuous Delivery. In the Continuous Delivery world, rather than hone skills at predicting the future via Big Design Up Front, the emphasis lies with techniques for understand and changing code with less cost during the process. I discuss the role of metrics to understand code, how Domain Driven Design’s Bounded Context reifies in architecture, how to reduce intra-component/service coupling, and microservices architectures, and other engineering techniques.

This presentation will give developers insight into how to model data in Cassandra, how to integrate Cassandra and Hadoop, and how to build big data platforms suitable for both batch and real-time processing while maintaining low latency response times suitable for web applications.
This session will go through various product development where Cassandra has shown to be the best choice. Focusing on the primary use-case: a tracking solution that collects raw time-series data in c* and aggregates it near real-time using Hadoop into various new datasets from advert-centric statistics to user-centric behavioural analysis. Mick will cover the final technical design chosen after three years of development iterations, touching on technologies: scribe, thrift, kafka, hadoop, pig, mahout; the hurdles faced along the way, integration improvements done between cassandra and hadoop, and the throughput and performance of today's systems.

Advice about software design focuses on the principles designers should adhere to and the structures that should be created. This leaves designers prone to creating the right design at the wrong time. "Why, When & How" fills this gap, giving designers an understanding of the overall goals of software design, when various techniques become relevant, and how to move smoothly from yesterday's design to today's.
Why A goal of software design is to enable changes to a program. We may optimize the speed with which the next feature appears (latency), the number of changes per unit time (throughput), or the predictability of features (variance). Software design is also an aesthetic experience for the designer. Optimizing for minimizing discomfort or maximizing satisfaction may conflict the the economic goals of the system. When The presumed high cost of change has led to bias for early design. However, speculative design comes with substantial costs. What are the tradeoffs that go into the decision that today is the day to change a design? How can designers actively use waiting as a design activity? How How can large changes to software design be made quickly, cheaply, and predictably? My bias is towards making large changes in small, safe steps. How is this practically done on large, production systems?

In this talk, we explore the bleedind edge of Continuous Delivery (CD). We discuss log-benchmark releases and elastic-scalability deployments as well as pros and cons of tools, e.g. comparing Chef and Puppet. All these discussions are embedded in the main part, that is an interactively set up delivery pipeline. Our pipeline integrates a lot of tools including Git, Artifactory, Bintray, Maven, Hudson/Jenkins, SonarQube, Flyway, Puppet/Chef, Vagrant and Docker. After attending this talk, you're on the bleeding edge of Continuous Delivery and DevOps.
Did you ever hear about these new things called Continuous Delivery and DevOps? In theory, all sounds so easy and meaningful. In practice, it's often hard to get started, both technically and non-technically, or to extend an existing solution to be robust and sustainable, and to span departments in the best possible way. This session shapes the core aspects of Continuous Delivery and DevOps. We talk about NoOps and deployment artifacts, including gradual log-benchmarked releases and pull-deployment/elastic-scalabillity zero downtime deployments. The main part of this session is the interactively set up example delivery pipeline pointing to good practices, proven in many big and complex project structures. After attending this session, you'll know the difference and interfaces of Continuous Delivery and DevOps, you'll be able to directly apply many recipes, know how to integrate lightweight best-of-breed tools as well as know about common pitfalls to look out for. You'll also be able to decide about what tool to choose, e.g. favor Chef over Puppet, or the other way round, and what's important about binary artifacts and how to make them cloud-enabled.

Developers who work with quantities (sensor reading from edge devices, scientific, engineering, medical, or manufacturing) need to handle measurements of these quantities in their programs. Inadequate models of physical measurements can lead to programmatic errors. In particular when modelling a measurement as a simple number with no regard to the units it represents creates fragile code. Another developer or part of the system can misinterpret the number as a different unit.
Developers who work with quantities (sensor reading from edge devices, scientific, engineering, medical, or manufacturing) need to handle measurements of these quantities in their programs. Inadequate models of physical measurements can lead to programmatic errors. In particular when modelling a measurement as a simple number with no regard to the units it represents creates fragile code. Another developer or part of the system can misinterpret the number as a different unit. For example, it may be unclear whether a person's mass is expressed in pounds, kilograms, or stones. A human reading „10°C“, „10 C“ or simply „10 Degrees“ may interpret each of those correctly. For M2M communication, unless a program contains a „Babel Fish“, such ambiguity would not be acceptable. Don’t Panic: After programming languages like Ada, C++, Eiffel or F# added type-safe Unit support already, JSR 363, Units of Measurement API will add similar support to the Java Platform, making it competitive for M2M in the Internet of Things with strong emphasis on sensors. This session provides an overview of popular use cases for the Units of Measurement JSR and implementations on both Java ME 8 Embedded (CLDC 8) and Java SE 8. A Hitchhiker’s guide across places where this JSR helps improve data quality or save lives by ensuring e.g. a patient receives the correct dosage of medicine or smart homes and similar energy saving measures prevents Earth from being destroyed by Global Warming (rather than waiting for a Vogon express route ;-)

This workshop will give you an introduction to Gradle. Comparing Gradle, Maven and touching other build as well. It will teach you why you should stop using Maven and start using Gradle instead. We will go through examples of both starting from scratch and bulding a project and examples of migrating already existing Maven builds to Gradle builds.
We will start with an introduction to Gradle and a discussion of Gradle compared to other build tools like Maven, Ant. We'll look at examples and exercises that will show you how you can migrate your existing projects from Maven to Gradle. We are also going to look at how you can build a project from scratch. This workshop will also go into solving the most common tasks people have to do, like building a fat jar. If we have time we will look at tips and tricks for Gradle. Talk a little about integration with IDEs and if there is interest for it we can spend some time on Android and Gradle. After this workshop you should be able to use Gradle instead of Maven and migrate your already existing projects to Gradle.

Why can’t we just add a feature to our system without tearing the code apart or, worse, patching around it? It ought to take just a few lines. We know the code is supposed to be modular and coherent, but too often it just doesn’t turn out that way.
We don’t believe it should be this hard to change object-oriented systems. We’ve seen examples where it really is that easy to add a new feature. The difference seems to be in the intermediate level structure. The design principles that most programmers rely on don’t address the middle ground where the complexity lies. We know about principles and patterns at the small scale, such as SOLID, and the large scale, such as REST. We’re less familiar with the structures in the middle. This talk is about design principles that we’ve learned help us develop mid-scale code structures that are easy to read and easy to change. At the lowest level, this means well-known patterns such as avoiding globals and following SOLID guidelines. At larger scales, this means assembling those SOLID objects to avoid hidden coupling so that the system as a whole is amenable to change. We focus on how objects fit together and communicate, and on being clear about how capabilities and information flow between objects in the running system.

In use in nine countries around Europe and having been live in production since 2007, Erex has stood the test of time as a powerful application for the calculation of railway energy settlements. This is a presentation and demonstration of how Erex uses adaptive object modelling to create a highly customisable calculation engine for the processing of time series data captured by the train energy metering points as they travel through time and space.
As a consumer of many gigawatt-hours of energy every year, the railway industry is obviously keen to save money by measuring the energy usage of its trains and improve their efficiency wherever possible. To accomplish this railway operators across Europe are equipping more and more of their train fleet with energy meters designed to constantly record energy consumption (and generation) and location information and then transmit this data elsewhere for further analysis. Harnessing this vast quantity of data to calculate an accurate quantity for settlement, while simultaneously dealing with varying local restrictions and regulations, energy prices, taxes, and various other factors is no small feat! Yet this is precisely what has been achieved by the Eress organisation's Erex project. This presentation will provide an insight into Erex, how we model our data, and the graph-based processing engine developed specifically for calculating energy settlement in an extremely configurable manner. More information about the Eress organisation and the Erex project can be found on the Eress homepage (http://www.eress.eu) and on Twitter (@EressOrg).

We are lucky to live in a Golden Age for IT geeks! On a given date one can pick and choose between a plethora of IT themed events via meetup.com and other channels. With so many options, it is tempting to assume that all this is here to stay. But is it? Well, that depends partly upon YOU! The sustainability of this ecosystem is more fragile than you might think. Organisers, presenters and participants all have important roles to play. Attend this session to find out how YOU can contribute to the continued success of the Meetup revolution!
As an Englishman, one of my favorite Norwegian words is 'Dugnad'. It’s one of those words that doesn’t directly translate to English but for any non-norwegian speakers this word refers to voluntary work undertaken by a group of people. An example – recently my children’s nursery had a Dugnad where all the parents donated a couple of hours to do small jobs around the building – things like fixing doors, painting walls and disposing of rubbish. Working together to improve ones local environment really gives you a sense of community. It can even become an addiction! The 'Dugnad spirit' extends to the IT community. A quick browse of meetup.com reveals dozens of IT themed events running constantly here in Oslo. And what is best is that the majority of these are free! But you know what? It takes time, money and above all effort to keep this machine working! In this lightning talk I will draw upon my experiences from arranging numerous events over the past three years and show you some simple and effective ways of making a contribution and keeping this community alive! My goals are to: 1. Summarise the etiquette of Meetups. 2. Show how you can help your local Meetup community to thrive. 3. Provide inspiration and guidance for starting your own Meetup.

There is a known vulnerability in a library you are using.... transitively....
Whether you are using npm, bower, maven or some other dependency management system, you are dragging in lots of dependencies. And most of them are transitive. As developers we all make mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes cause serious security holes. But not every library gets it's own Heartbleed style web page and media coverage. So how do we figure out any of our libraries have known security issues?

Introductory workshop to Akka with hands-on exercises and slides. Participants can choose to do exercises in Java or Scala. The following parts of Akka will be covered: Actors (creating them, their life-cycle and communication via messages), Supervision and Death Watch, and Routers.
User today expect responsive applications with close to zero downtime. To achieve this, concurrency, parallelism and fault tolerance is a necessity, however, building such systems is a complex task. Akka addresses the complexity of building scalable and fault tolerant systems. Participants of the workshop will learn about Akka's primary abstraction, the actor model. Participants will also learn about how actors achieve fault tolerance through supervision and death watch, and scalability through routers. Each concept in Akka will be covered with slides containing theory and mostly code examples, and concrete exercises where the participant can choose to use Java (8) or Scala. It is recommended that participants bring their own laptop, or participate in pair-programming, for the exercises.

Go reactive with me as I'll demonstrate how you can utilize react.js to build an interactive client-server web application in the browser.
Learn how to "think in React". This means throwing out the classic notion of using templates and building views with Javascript, and re-rendering your entire application everytime your data changes. This a radical approach that requires a new way of thinking when you're developing apps. In this talk I'll walk you through a demo app which will show you how React components are built, how they operate, how they communicate with each other, and how to test them.

Code that we produce sucks! In this session, not only will we learn how to code better, but also how to raise the bar on a daily basis.
Business project are intensive and tiring. Tight deadlines often make developers produce the infamous "enterprise" code, the quality of which is the least important factor. "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit" Aristotle used to say. Deploying our skills, however, is almost mutually exclusive from mastering them… In this session we will cover 33 things you want to do better, quicker and simpler applying the best of Guava, Lombok, LambdaJ, Mockito, Spock, Byteman, Groovy, Gradle, Logback, Git, Shell and others! Using some real-life examples we will have a peek at the code, analyze the flaw and propose a suitable solution. Not only will we learn how to code better, but also how to raise the bar on a daily basis!

Performance testing is often resource heavy and in need for special software and equipment. This talk will show you how you can do lightweight performance testing to get a feel of how your system will perform under stress straight from within your familiar IDE.
In small to medium sized projects performance testing is often the last thing to be thought of, if at all. The purpose of this talk is to show that it is fully possible for even the smallest of projects to get an indication of performance and find congestion points without the need for full scale stress test. By using readily available free (as in beer) open source performance tools it is easy and fun to set up some tests in only a couple of hours of effort. The talk will be using the Gatling stress tool to illustrate examples of testing scenarios.
Håkon T Sønderland is a systems consultant for Antares Gruppen AS. He has developed software professionally since 1986. The last 10 years mostly in Java, for the web. He has destroyed performance in applications and created catastrophes in code long enough to appreciate the ability to test performance easily.

After Object-Databases, XML-Databases, ORMs, and NoSQL, we dare have a look at SQL, the core database language and how it evolved - from a Java perspective.
In the past decade, RDBMS related traction has moved away completely from SQL towards JPA / JPQL, or even further, towards NoSQL. Evangelists have widely agreed that RDBMS are not "web scale", even if the race is far from being decided. In this talk, I want to show you how many features you're missing out on, when you don't do real SQL. When you don't take advantage of recent SQL standard evolutions, such as SQL:1999 hierarchical SQL, SQL:2003 window functions, or many vendor specific extensions. In an example session, we're going to look at how we can calculate running totals on medium-sized data sets using - nested selects - window functions - hierarchical SQL - the Oracle MODEL clause - stored functions And most importantly, we're going to see how the above can help us increase performance while we decrease the number of lines of code when using any of MyBatis, jOOQ, or SpringJDBC.
I am the founder and CEO of Data Geekery GmbH, located in Zurich, Switzerland. With my company I have been selling database products and services around Java and SQL since 2013.

Most of this experience I have obtained in the Swiss E-Banking field through various variants (JDBC, Hibernate, mostly with Oracle). I am happy to share this knowledge at various conferences, JUGs, in-house presentations and on my blog.

Log messages in files are a pain: they are hard to get hold of, difficult to search, and different sources are tedious to combine. This talk shows you ways to use logs as a real time source of information to react on problems – even before you users file a ticket!
Each node in every layer of your application has its own log file. In a production environment you need an admin to grant you access to the log files. Whenever you search for the causes of an error you will need to combine multiple log files to get the information you need. This talk puts the spot light on three tools that help handling log messages. All of them provide access controls for your logs and can alert you when there are problem. But each of them has a different focus. These tools are Errbit, logFaces and graylog2. Errbit will receive all error messages from your application, from the back end and the frontend. It will group them for you so you know how many times the same error occurred. With every occurrence of an error it will store all context information so that you can easily browse it. It can also store release information to show you when this error occurred for the first time and when it was fixed. logFaces receives the full log stream from your application and makes it searchable. You can prepare search filters that help you with recurring tasks. From a given log message you can dig into your logs to find more about the same user, session or class. You can even see a live log stream of your application. grayLog2 gives you a highly scalable architecture and will process all your log files. It will index them using elasticsearch and search it for you using simple and complex queries. You can put the results as performance indicators or charts on dashboards that show you the current health status of your system. graylog2 has been completely redesigned for release 0.20; this talk will show the new features. This talk will help you to choose the right tool for the job. It will enable you to find the information without the hassle. These tools are the key to find and solve problems before your users complain and file a ticket.

Transitioning the citizen services completely open source - utilizing Java. Migrating and restructuring existing services and departments into a single cohesive scalable resource for delivering online information for services such as, vehicle information, civil service, judicial and anything else a government entity will require. A complete SOA restructuring of disparate systems, languages and services built on proprietary systems, integration of non standards compliant web services, databases, regionally distributed system while increasing uptime, scalability, response time and management of a single master data source.
This session presents a case study of a complete transition of citizen services to an open source platform, combining NoSQL, Camel, SOA techniques, and proven Java EE technologies. It shows how a scalable, distributed, secure system was built with modular rapid development techniques. The system integrates disparate proprietary and legacy systems into a fast, modern open source solution and puts the information necessary from each government entity into the hands of the citizens.

Unit testing ensures your production code is relevant. But what does ensure your testing code is relevant? Come discover mutation testing and make sure your never forget another assert again.
In the realm of testing, the code coverage metrics is the most often talked about. A line (or a branch) is considered to have been covered if during test execution this line has been run. However, it doesn't mean that the test has been useful or even that an assert has been coded. Mutation testing creates mutants from code - a deviation from the written code, and test them also. If a test still passes on a mutant, then the test is not relevant. PIT is a Java tool that makes mutation testing possible.

Event sourcing and CQRS are trending technologies. They free you from the tyranny of relational databases, ER-modeling, object relational mapping and impedance mismatch and let you implement truly modern applications: domain driven, asynchronous, reactive, and horizontally scalable!
Event sourcing and CQRS are trending technologies. They free you from the tyranny of relational databases, ER-modeling, object relational mapping and impedance mismatch and let you implement truly modern applications: domain driven, asynchronous, reactive, and horizontally scalable! Many developers have read up on event sourcing, but fewer have have actually built applications leveraging the technique. During this workshop you will create an event sourced application, learn best practices for design and implementation, experience pitfalls and discover solutions. No previous knowledge of event sourcing is required - we will kick off with a overview of the architecture where new concepts are introduced, and the goals and limitations of the technology are discussed. Bring your own laptop with your preferred dev environment. Examples will be given in Java, but you're free to use your favorite language.

TDD gives us quality of code. BDD builds upon TDD to enable us to get quality from functional requirements. The goal is to guide us programmers to code what our customers wants.
BDD is all about writing your requirements as tests. From TDD we know that tests form your code design. BDD is all about having your requirements expressed through unit tests. This enables us to produce live project reports, automate our requirements, discuss the requirements with our customer, enable the customer to see live project status. Reduce misunderstanding. In the end giving the customer what he/she really wants. In this talk I will give an overview on BDD. I will give an introduction to BDD as it is practiced on a high level. But the focus will be on low level practices hoping to appeal more to programmers.

Architecting and developing user interfaces used to be relatively easy, pick a server side framework, define a standard monitor resolution and spend your days dealing with browser quirks. But today, the landscape presents us with a plethora of screen sizes and resolutions covering everything from a phone to a tablet to a TV.
Architecting and developing user interfaces used to be relatively easy, pick a server side framework, define a standard monitor resolution and spend your days dealing with browser quirks. But today, the landscape presents us with a plethora of screen sizes and resolutions covering everything from a phone to a tablet to a TV. How does a team embrace this brave new world knowing that the future will introduce even more volatility to the client space? This talk will walk you through this brave new world. We'll discuss the deluge of devices the typical application must deal with today as well as looking at the plethora of client side rendering technologies. This isn't strictly a front end problem though, we need to reconsider how we've built our server side solutions as well; modern applications rely on RESTful web services delivering data to a diverse set of clients. The development landscape has changed, this talk will prepare you to face these challenges.

Java, Scala, Groovy: in the end, all JVM languages compile down to the class file format and Java byte code. It is thanks to the flexibility of this intermediate instruction set that the JVM became a platform so rich in languages. And the ability to generate byte code at run time is a prerequisite for many popular libraries such as Spring or Hibernate. This talk gives an introduction to compiled Java code and discusses different libraries for generating classes at run time.
At a first glance, Java byte code can appear to be some low level magic that is both hard to understand and effectively irrelevant to application developers. However, neither is true. With only little practice, Java byte code becomes easy to read and can give true insights into the functioning of a Java program. In this talk, we will cast light on compiled Java code and its interplay with the Java virtual machine. In the process, we will look into the evolution of byte code over the recent major releases with features such as dynamic method invocation which is the basis to Java 8 lambda expressions. Finally, we will learn about tools for the run time generation of Java classes and byte code. Among those tools, I will present Byte Buddy, a novel open source code generator which is an attempt to considerably simplify run time code generation in Java.
Rafael is a software engineer at Kantega, specialized on the Java platform. He has a particular interest in concurrency, functional programing and byte code engineering.

When coding outside of his workplace, Rafael is working on Byte Buddy, a library for run time code generation.

The theme of this talk is that conventional power to IT Architects, and to IT Managers, the power to design the technical system, and Management power to design the IT or Software Organization is not placed in the right hands.
The theme of this talk is that conventional power to IT Architects, and to IT Managers, the power to design the technical system, and Management power to design the IT or Software Organization is not placed in the right hands. We have a number of historical case studies that show, that when this power is delegated to the developer level, then they actually do a much more impressive job of getting things right. We have case studies from IBM, Raytheon, Confirmit (Norway), Boeing, Primark (UK), and Citigroup which show that when management delegates the detailed planning and decision making to the programmer level, and uses such tactics as Defect Prevention Process (DPP, CMMI 5) and Evolutionary Value Delivery (Evo), using quantified goals and frequent quantified feedback (Agile as it was meant to be), then the results are far better than anything otherwise reported or known. The simple reason is that: Programmers are on the shop floor, and know what is realistic Programmers can make, and measure detailed technical decisions, evolutionarily, iteratively, and incrementally, that Architects and Managers cannot. So, it is not even a matter of programmers grabbing the power, but that it is in management interest to delegate it to them. This is not new. It is built into the original ‘agile’ concept (try Deming’s PDSA). But you have to add some quantification, and think like real software engineers, not mere ‘coders’. Are you up for that?
Tom Gilb is an American systems engineer, consultant, and author, known for the development of software metric, software inspection, and evolutionary processes. He coaches managers and product owners, writes papers, develops the courses. There are very many organizations and individuals who use some or all of their methods. IBM and HP were two early corporate adopters. Recently over 15,000 (and growing) engineers at Intel have adopted the “Planguage” requirements methods. Ericsson, Nokia and recently Nordea and Statoil and A Major Multinational Finance Group use parts of their methods extensively. Many smaller companies also use the methods.
Kai Gilb Kai Gilb has partnered with Tom in developing these ideas, holding courses and practicing them with clients since 1992. He coaches managers and product owners, writes papers, develops the courses, and is writing his own book, ‘Evo – Evolutionary Project Management & Product Development.’ Tom & Kai work well as a team, they approach the art of teaching their common methods somewhat differently.

This live demo shows you how to create advanced web applications using the canvas element of HTML5. The Canvas Library framework and IDE lets you create the user interface for both business applications and games quickly and easily. As a programmer, you can finally make web applications the same way desktop applications have been made for years. As a web designer, you can create stunning UIs that will work directly in the browser, without having to find a programmer to implement your sketches.
The canvas element in HTML5 allows you to draw graphics directly onto a web page, without a plugin. Sounds great, right? But what do we use it for? HTML was designed for text with hyperlinks, not rich web applications. While you can make applications in HTML these days, canvas is much easier. Provided you have the right set of tools, that is. This talk demonstrates the tools you need: a library of user interface components, and an IDE to quickly assemble them into a working application. During the session, we will use the IDE to build a small demo application. This will demonstrate what you can do with a canvas, and convince you that, if you are looking to develop advanced user interfaces quickly, you should be using the Canvas Library.
I am a front end developer and Javascript expert, 37 years old, currently employed at Accenture Norway. I write code at work, in my spare time and in my sleep. I am a proud member of the minority who actually love Javascript, and used Ajax long before anyone thought to call it that. At some point in the murky past, I picked up a degree ("sivilingeniør") from NTNU in Trondheim, and went on to write online game applications for Norsk Tipping starting 2001. While at Norsk Tipping, I created the framework known as Canvas Library (for lack of an actual name). I find the Canvas Library to be very interesting indeed, and every demonstration I have given thus far has led me to believe that a lot of other people would be similarly interested in it as well.

Let's get a handle on what your JVM is doing using system tools as well as JDK tools like jps, jstack, Mission Control and Flight Recoder. Using real world examples we try to get a handle on common development mistakes and performance problems.
Java is continuously evolving and each release brings new features. For sure you heard about Lambdas for Java 8, right? Who hasn’t? Unfortunately, despite all new language features developers still often struggle with performance issues and memory leaks. How do you go about solving these problems? Luckily, Java tooling support is evolving as well, but much more hidden for many. When was the last time you looked into the bin directory of your JDK? Ever heard of tools like jps, jstack or jmap? What’s about Mission Control and Flight Recoder? Java provides everything you need to track down performance and memory problems. No need for expensive 3rd party tools. In this session we are having a closer look at the above mentioned tools, in particular Mission Control. Where do I find them, how do I start them and how can they be used to solve my problems? To keep things real, we will use real world examples from projects like Hibernate Validator and Search. Buckle up and get learn how to get back into control of your JVM.

Lessons learnt using web APIs and composable services to build a database server and its testing infrastructure.
In the mid-2000s I was using the web as a platform for building and integrating enterprise apps. This led to my co-authoring 'REST in Practice', a guide to applying web technologies and the tenets of REST in the enterprise. Then, in 2011, I joined a database company - a graph database company. Here, we applied the ideas that inspired 'REST in Practice' to a quite different set of architectural problems. In this session I'll discuss some the things I've learnt in applying 'REST in Practice' in a new context: implementing a database server API, and building the infrastructure we use for testing clusters, bootstrapping proofs-of-concept, reproducing customer scenarios, and benchmarking the database. My experience has reinforced many of the core precepts of the book, but it has also led me to qualify and revise others - and even, in some cases, to consider alternative web-based approaches.
Ian works on research and development for future versions of the Neo4j graph database. Harbouring a long-held interest in connected data, he has for many years been one of the foremost proponents of REST architectures. His recent work with Neo4j has led him to extend the application of his ideas, from the Web's global graph to the realm of graph databases. He is a coauthor of 'Graph Databases' and 'REST in Practice' (O'Reilly), and a contributor to 'REST: From Research to Practice' (Springer) and 'Service Design Patterns' (Addison-Wesley). He blogs at http://iansrobinson.com, and tweets at @iansrobinson.

Hafslund is developing a service for managing and controlling smart homes built on Scala and Akka. A gateway in the users' homes runs embedded Linux with a lightweight Akka application collecting data from sensors and sending commands to devices to control the home. Another Akka system in the cloud gathers data and enables users to manage their home via a phone app.
This session will cover Hafslund's 18 months experience developing the Akka-based real-time system handling millions of events per second, the way we've applied the various items in the Akka toolbox, strengths and weaknesses we've come across and our overall impressions so far. While the type of system we're developing has felt like a sweet spot for Akka all the way, we've hit a number of stumbling blocks - probably common ones - which I'll talk through and examine the architectural decisions we've made to work around them.
Owen is project lead for the Hafslund Link project. He's been an avid fan of Scala and Akka for 5 years and has been using them professionally for most of that time. Tell, don't ask.

Modularity is an architectural theme that you'll hear about more and more. Being able to deal with change in a codebase is not something trivial and requires some serious thought. In this talk I will show you that it is actually pretty easy to achieve a modular architecture using OSGi, and the right set of tools. Of course everything will be demonstrated using live coding!
In this presentation you will learn how to create modular, robust, and durable enterprise Java applications fit for the Cloud Age. Using a modular development approach with Java, OSGi, and a wealth of open source components, you will be shown how to combine these into coherent applications without locking into one of the existing PaaS providers. Finally, we will focus on deployment, introducing Apache ACE, that allows to centrally manage and distribute software components to target systems in the cloud or on premise. The presenter of this talk authored the book 'Building Modular Cloud Apps with OSGi' and is using these techniques in high profile production applications on a daily basis.

This 2 hour workshop will teach you how to build a mobile native application for iOS, Android and other platforms in Java by leveraging the Codename One platform and API. During the course of this workshop we will actually build a working usable application that uses device functionality and deploy it to your devices!
This workshop will start with a brief overview of what Codename One is and isn't which should be quick and familiar to Java developers. It will then delve into the process of building an application with Codename One highlighting device feature usage such as camera API's, location etc. The highlight of the workshop is the deployment to actual devices, this is a tricky bit due to Apples restrictions on device deployment.

Concurrency has become an increasingly important topic in the Java space. Nevertheless, most Java developers do not address concurrency in their unit tests. This talk shows how to and how not to test concurrent code and introduces Thread Weaver, a library for testing concurrent code.
While software engineers can disagree on almost any concept of programming best-practice, the necessity of writing unit tests remains undisputed. With the advent of concurrent applications and the ongoing deprecation of the one-thread-per-request model, unit tests do however miss an increasing fraction of programing errors such as race conditions or dead-locking code. But is it even possible to write tests that revise such errors? In the end, a good unit test is characterized by a determined execution path what effectively prevents the use of concurrency within a single test. However, there are tools and programming principles that allow for unit tests of concurrent code. This talk reviews typical mistakes made when concurrent code is tested and introduces Thread Weaver, a test suite for writing valid unit tests that uncover concurrency-related programming errors.

H2O - It's open source, in-memory, big data, clustered computing - Math At Scale. We got the Worlds Fastest Logistic Regression (by a lot!), world's first (and fastest) distributed Gradient Boosted Method (GBM), plus Random Forest, PCA, KMeans++, etc... R's "plyr" style data munging at-scale, including ddply (Group-By for you SQL'rs) and much of R's expressive coding style.
We built H2O, an open-source platform for working with in-memory distributed data. Then we built on top of H2O state-of-the-art predictive modeling and analytics (e.g. GLM & Logistic Regression, GBM, Random Forest, Neural Nets, PCA to name a few) that's 1000x faster than the disk-bound alternatives, and 100x faster than R (we love R but it's tooo slow on big data!). We can run R expressions on tera-scale datasets, or munge data from Scala & Python. We're building our newest algorithms in a few weeks, start to finish, because the platform makes Big Math easy. We routinely test on 100G datasets, have customers using 1T datasets. This talk is about the platform, coding style & API that lets us seamlessly deal with datasets from 1K to 1TB without changing a line of code, lets us use clusters ranging from your laptop to 100 server clusters with many many TB of ram and hundreds of CPUs.

In the past year the Arduino micro controller has become a hot topic amongst developers in Norway but it has existed for quite a few years. These are great boards for playing with and writing code to control physical things but is it really possible to use one of these for something in real life?
In the past 3 years Motorbike racing has taken a big step into the world of electronics which comes at a huge cost to the teams / riders if they want to buy and use some of these electronics. I race motorbikes in the UK and around Scandinavia and for the 2013 season I decided it was possible to make my own data logging system for my race bike using an Arduino & Raspberry PI. In this talk I will cover the highs and lows of trying to do such a thing, giving you details of what you can do at home to get a similar results. Its worth watching my introduction lightning talk from last year - http://vimeo.com/74300430
My name is Marty Cochrane, I was born and raised in Ireland where I started my software career at a large Coal fired Power Station writing ladder logic for PLC's that controlled various parts of the power station. I moved on after university to become a Java Developer working with enterprise Java applications for a top fortune 500 company. I moved to Norway 2 years ago where I started working as a developer in Statkraft, developing business critical applications used everyday to bid Statkraft's power on to the various Nordic electricity markets. Outside of work I spend most of my time working on and racing motorbikes. I love what I do in work and I love what I do outside of work so I try to join these together as much as possible. Normally this means I spend most of my time out in my garage giving myself electric shocks and creating blue smoke as I realise I have wired something completely wrong. Sometimes though I actually get a result from the hundreds of hours spent working on these things and I love sharing what I discovered with others.

All theory regarding consensus algorithms refer to the Paxos algorithm. The original paper describing Paxos have been very influential, but many describe it as hard to comprehend and many of those who don't have failed at trying to implement it.
In this talk I will try to give a more easily comprehensible description as I tell the tale of the mythical greek island called Paxos. On the Paxos island legislators passed laws by passing notes using unreliable couriers and at the same time leaving and returning to the senate whenever they felt like it. The incredible thing is that they still managed to consensus on their ledgers of all the laws that had been passed.

We used to have a simple, declarative web. Then we got fancy and everything has gone crazy. The Polymer project is an attempt to use W3C standards to reclaim the simple, declarative Web while still allowing us our modern whizzy UIs.
Enough with the darn JavaScript frameworks already! There's nothing wrong with a judicious use of this ubiquitous programming language, but it's gotten a little out of hand. What if there were an evolvable future state of declarative and encapsulated user interface elements that was available today in most modern browsers? There is! The Polymer Project is a young but impressive glimpse into where things should go. It's goals are: - Use the platform - Everything is an element - Eliminate boilerplate This talk will introduce you to: - The Polymer Project - The strategy for supporting today's browsers with tomorrow's technologies - Application frameworks that build upon these core technologies - Custom visual and non-visual elements - The underlying W3C Specifications that engender all of this

Do unit tests make life better? Should we develop using test driven development (TDD)? What exactly are our customers paying for? These questions, and others, will be answered definitively in this session.
Software development is hard. Unit testing and Test Driven Development (TDD) can make it easier, but only if done well - and that takes time. In this session we will cover: - HOW these practices can help your project, - WHAT you can do to get better at them, and - WHY your boss should care. You’ll learn about project risk and how developer testing can improve the chances of a successful delivery. You’ll see how developer tests don’t just protect against regression, but also act as a primary source of documentation. And we’ll take a few hints from the ancient Egyptians! You might have heard people say: - “Tests make it hard to refactor.” - “The customer doesn’t care how many tests there are.” - “If we had to work the way the agile gurus tell us, nothing would ever get done.” If you’ve ever struggled to respond to these challenges, then this session is for you. A note about the title: In Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy the dolphins leave planet earth before it gets destroyed, with their last enigmatic message “So long, and thanks for all the fish” being misinterpreted. Is our software giving us the same message? After all, the software would still perform the same function without the tests, wouldn’t it?

Do you wonder how the "log in with Facebook"-option in many applications work? Open authentication 2.0 is an open standard that is implemented (with a few variations) in a number of platforms. It allows you to create a secure application without dealing with passwords and it enables ecosystems of cooperating applications. If you want to simplify the login for your users, use third party APIs or provide a flexible security framework for your internal application ecosystem, this talk will show you how.
We will show a simple example of an application that authenticates with OAuth 2.0 with a number of providers and break down the application flow. The flow of OAuth 2.0 is very simple and provides many benefits. The talk will cover what you need to understand in order to use or build an OAuth provider.

This talk covers some concrete, practical advice for people building, or considering building, microservice arcitectures.
So you’ve heard about the buzz behind Microservices and finer-grained architectures in general? Microservice architectures can lead to easier to change, more maintainable systems which can be more secure, performant and stable than previous designs. But what are the practical concerns associated with running more fine-grained systems, and what are the new things you’ll need to know if you want to embrace the power of smaller services without the new sources of complexity making your life a nightmare? This talk will delve deeper into the characteristics of well-behaved services, and will define some clear principles your services should follow. It will also discuss in more depth some of the challenges associated with managing and monitoring more complex distributed systems. We’ll discuss how you can design services to be more fault-tolerant, what technologies may exist in your own platform to get you started. We’ll end by giving some pointers as to when you should consider microservice architectures, and how you should go about introducing them in your own organisation. This talk gives practical advice to help you adopt Microservice architectures in your own organisations, based on real-world experience of building similar systems gathered from all over the industry.

Java 8 introduces a new Stream concept for iterating over structures. In what way is this different from traditional iterator based iteration? In what situations can you benefit from using Stream? When is it not possible? Finally, we will look at how to Stream enable your own data.
Java 8 has adopted a new paradigm for iteration, inspired by recent trends and other languages. Traditionally Java iteration has been iterator based. Iterators are complex to write and have many inherent limitations. With the new Stream abstraction, the iteration is no longer driven by the consumer, so the implementor has greater freedom to implement and optimise. The interface also includes new and valuable functionality at your fingertips. The default Stream support in Java 8, is however still based on iterators. Therefore as a final exercise, we will look at ways to Stream enable code, without the burden of an iterator. This is the final step to make your iteration truly internal.

Macros are a core part of Clojure, probably its most powerful feature. To fully understand Clojure you need to understand macros. In this talk we will do a deep dive into Clojure's macro system.
Clojure is arguably one of the most powerful languages on the JVM, and it is gaining in popularity. But to really understand its power, we need to take a deeper look into one of its core features. In this talk, we will do a deep dive into Clojure’s macro system, understanding how it works, when to use macros, and when not to use them. Getting into macros, means understanding the reader, the compiler and the runtime. Hence understanding macros, means really understanding Clojure. After this talk you should have a better perception on how this wonderful language actually works!

Groupon recently completed a year-long project to migrate its web traffic from a monolithic Ruby on Rails application to a new multi-application stack with substantial results. Learn the strategies, techniques, and tools used to accomplish this!
Groupon recently completed a year-long project to migrate its U.S. web traffic from a monolithic Ruby on Rails application to a new multi-application stack with substantial results. Groupon's entire U.S. web frontend had been a single Rails codebase from its inception in 2008. The frontend codebase quickly grew large, which made it difficult to maintain and challenging to ship new features. As a solution to this gigantic monolith, we decided to re-architect the frontend by splitting it into small, independent and more manageable pieces which we integrated into a cohesive whole. At the center of this project, we rebuilt each major section of the website as an independent application. We also rebuilt the infrastructure to make all the independent apps work together. Interaction Tier (I-Tier) was the result. Learn the strategies, techniques, and tools used to peel apart a monolithic application, and then integrate dozens of smaller applications into a cohesive, faster to run, faster to evolve, and easier to maintain whole!
Brian McCallister joined Groupon as CTO of Platform in 2013. Prior to Groupon, he was Principal Architect and Distinguished Engineer at Ning, where he was responsible for directing and communicating the technical big picture across the organization. He joined Ning originally as a Core Architect when it was a tiny startup and watched it grow to over two hundred people. At the Apache Software Foundation, Brian has served on the Board of Directors and as PMC Chairs for the DB and ActiveMQ projects. Within the ASF he has focused on pushing for greater project autonomy, and mentoring and shepherding a number of projects into the foundation, including Cassandra, Mesos, and Jclouds. In his broader past, Brian has worked variously as a programmer, engineering manager, technical writer, and systems administrator on projects ranging from internet platforms to loom control drivers. He is also a great mentor, and takes a vested interest in developing other engineers to help turn them into great engineers. Brian holds an MS in Education and BA in English both from Bucknell University.

According to many researches, we learn the best when we experience it personally, and we comprehend when we teach to someone else. So if you want to achieve ample understanding of a topic, you’ll need to follow these basic steps: “Listen -&gt; Observe -&gt; Do -&gt; Share” Fibonacci Pairing is simple yet very effective technique that can improve team work.
Pair-programming is a well-known practice, and it has been introduced by one of the thought leaders of Agile world, Kent Beck. I respect any technique that encourages collaboration and interaction among teams, and gets teams to communicate better. However, if you want to establish understanding of mastery or a skill-set, and increase the shared knowledge across your team members, then you need to re-think & apply new techniques. In this talk, I’ll share about What-Why-How of "Fibonacci Pairing" technique, which is yet another discovery from practice. The main goal of that technique is to establish understanding and improve collaboration, without overcrowding by artificial ways like lecturing. This technique should be regarded as a complementary way to improve team work effectively. We will elaborate with practical examples, real life experiences, and applicable ways onto different contexts.

Interpolation is the act of filling in the blanks between to discrete states. This can be as simple as moving a dot from one part of the screen to another, changing a color from red to blue - or displaying the balance of your bank-account draining away till nothing remains. This will be a peek at the math of interpolation - the in-between of theory and application.
Today interpolation and tweening is readily available in various libraries; animating DOM elements on the web has for many become second nature curtsy of jQuery and others. This talk tries to talk one step back and take a look at the (relatively simple) math behind interpolation. A walkthrough of how a basic mathematical formula can be adapted to provide a vast range dynamic animations, which can be applied to an array of front-end attributes; position, size, color and rotation. Inspired by Flash animator Robert Penner, the presentation seeks to use the very concepts of the talk as a visual aid to illustrate the topic at hand, in what is hopefully a visually interesting ride from A to B - and in-between.
I used to procrastinate by playing games. Now I procrastinate gaming by dabbling in game-making. I'd like to think I learned something while pushing pixels to the screen and watching them move. I like moving pixels. They are pretty.

This lab offers developers an intro-level, hands-on session with Docker, from installation (including boot2docker on Windows/Mac), to exploring Docker Hub, to crafting their own images, to adding Java apps and running custom containers. It will also explain how to use Kubernetes to orchestrate these containers together.
Containers are enabling developers to package their applications (and underlying dependencies) in new ways that are portable and work consistently everywhere? On your machine, in production, in your data center, and in the cloud. And Docker has become the de facto standard for those portable containers in the cloud, whether you’re working with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure. Docker is the developer-friendly Linux container technology that enables creation of your stack: OS, JVM, app server, app, and all your custom configuration. So with all it offers, how comfortable are you and your team taking Docker from development to production? Are you hearing developers say, “But it works on my machine!” when code breaks in production? And if you are, how many hours are then spent standing up an accurate test environment to research and fix the bug that caused the problem? This lab offers developers an intro-level, hands-on session with Docker, from installation (including boot2docker on Windows/Mac), to exploring Docker Hub, to crafting their own images, to adding Java apps and running custom containers. It will also explain how to use Kubernetes to orchestrate these containers together. This is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop and be ready to dig into a tool that promises to be at the forefront of our industry for some time to come.

How can you make sure that code which was written some time ago is still readable and can be understood by you and your team? How can you ensure that all developers of a team write high quality code? How can you find bugs in your code before the product is deployed?
This talk will introduce techniques for doing code reviews. Readable, high quality code is essential for the long term success of a project. Code reviews are an enabling factor to write code which can be extended and maintained easily. We will also have a look at some tools which can help with and partially automate code reviews. I will include the personal experiences I have made since starting with code reviews and how to avoid some common pitfalls. The talk will answer the following questions: - How can we start with code reviews? - Who is doing code reviews? - Should we review every line of code? - We are doing TDD, do we need code reviews? - How do I pass knowledge during code review? - Which tools can support the code review process? - How can all team members enjoy code reviews?

Learn about HTTP/2 and its relationship to HTTP 1.1 and SPDY through an open source project from Square called okhttp. Understand how HTTP/2 works at a network level and how things like header compression matter. Leave with a solid understanding of what HTTP/2 buys you and how it impacts how to design HTTP Apis.
Developers choose HTTP for its ubiquity. HTTP’s semantics are cherry-picked or embraced in the myriad of apis we develop and consume. Efficiency discussions are commonplace: Does this design imply N+1 requests? Should we denormalize the model? How do consumers discover changes in state? How many connections are needed to effectively use this api? Meanwhile, HTTP 1.1 is a choice, as opposed to constant. SPDY and HTTP/2 implementations surface, simultaneously retaining semantics and dramatically changing performance implications. We can choose treat these new protocols as more efficient versions HTTP 1.1 or buy into new patterns such as server-side push. This session walks you through these topics via an open source project from Square called okhttp. You’ll understand how okhttp addresses portability so that you can develop against something as familiar as java’s HTTPUrlConnection. We’ll review how to use new protocol features and constraints to keep in mind along the way. You’ll learn how to sandbox ideas with okhttp’s mock server so that you can begin experimenting with SPDY and HTTP/2 today!

Most NoSQL databases use an eventual consistency model for better scalability. This talk explains the CAP theorem, how it relates to eventual consistency, other possible solutions, and also explains how consistency is directly related to Einstein's theory of relativity. Finally, there is a surprise.
The CAP theorem says you have to choose between consistency or availability. In essence, this is the trade-off between having nodes communicate upfront about writes to ensure clients get the same answers from all nodes, or reducing communication at the cost of giving clients inconsistent answers depending on which node they are talking to. SQL databases choose consistency, while NoSQL databases generally choose availability via eventual consistency. This talk explains the theorem and the various approaches to scalability and their benefits and problems. It also explains how this is directly related to the central insight in Einstein's theory of relativity: time is not absolute, or, as it's sometimes phrased, there is no now. Finally, the talk shows how the insight from relativity has been used to scale consistent databases.

With the introduction of the Nashorn JavaScript engine in Java 8, it is possible to run modern (ECMAScript 5.1) JS in the JVM. This allows for reusing existing JavaScript frameworks, or even running Node.js applications within your Java-applications. Are there any compelling reasons for doing this? We’ll show you how easy it is to include JavaScript in your stack, talk about how it differs from Node.js and the browser, and try to pinpoint a few use cases.
Java has had the capability of running JavaScript for some time now, but it’s only with JDK 8 that support for modern JavaScript has caught up. In this talk we will show you some of the things that are possible to do with Nashorn. For instance, you can use JavaScript frameworks that don’t have any Java counterparts, or you can easily open up scripting possibilities within your applications. Another possibility is to handle JSON objects in JavaScript instead of in your Java code, or even share code between the client and the server. Nashorn even allows you to call Java methods from the JavaScript code. In addition Nashorn supports some JavaScript extension that might be worth a look, for instance passing a JavaScript object as a literal to a Java method. To finish off we will take a look at how Nashorn allows you to run multi-threaded JavaScript, and see if there are any pitfalls.
Magnus Bae is a software engineer at Itera Norway. He is an utter car bore, but loves everything that's engineered. Programming-wise he has worked with everything from race cars (actual) to Dynamics CRM, but his main competency is still Java. No one escapes JavaScript, and what better to do with JS than to run it in the JVM - right?

Are you overwhelmed by all the big data and NoSQL buzzwords? Do you feel drowned in the sea of all the new and exotic technologies you hear about everyday?

OWASP developed the Application Security Verification Standard to help develop and maintain secure applications. The talk will discuss the standard and give details how to achive advanced level.
OWASP developed the Application Security Verification Standard to help develop and maintain secure applications. This is a very usable standard. It contains checklists in sixteen requirement areas, ranging from authentication, session management to mobile verification. There are three levels of compliance (opportunistic, standard and advanced). During the presentation we will give an overview of these requirements and give some ideas of how the advanced level can be reached in a simple sample (business) application. This will be achieved using a skeleton application built using a Java back-end (using JEE) and a JavaScript front-end (using Angular). You will see the challenges and how they were overcome.

This talk is about how to secure your front-end + backend applications using a RESTful approach. As opposed to traditional and monolithic server-side applications (where the HTTP session is used), when your front-end application is running on a browser and not securely from the server, there are few things you need to consider. In this session Alvaro will explore standards like OAuth and JWT to achieve a stateless, token-based authentication and authorisation. He will explore the existing impl More specifically, the demonstration will be made using Spring Security REST, a popular Grails plugin written by Álvaro.
Authentication is normally a stateful service. Most of the implementations rely on the HTTP session, thus introducing state as the session is an in-memory data structure in the application server. In the microservices era, most of the companies are developing such called RESTful services, where one of the principles is to create stateless systems. In such scenario, authentication should be stateless too. There is a standard specification to secure web application and API's, that is being adopted massively by the industry: OAuth 2. The specification doesn't explicitly cover how to make a stateless implementation. And most of the existing ones depend on some sort of external storage (such as a DB) to store the tokens generated for a later validation. Fortunately, there is another specification by the IETF called JSON Web Token, that can be combined with OAuth 2 to achieve a stateless authentication system. In the session, Alvaro will explain the core concepts of OAuth 2, as well as JWT and how can them be used together to achieve the last 2 letters of REST: State Transfer.
Álvaro is a passionate software architect and agile enthusiast with over 14 years of experience. He started his career in 2001 coding in Perl and Java, but then quickly focused on Java EE, working for companies like IBM BCS, BEA Systems or Sun Microsystems. He created his own company in 2005, Salenda, and since 2007 he specialised on Groovy/Grails, introducing them in Spain by founding Escuela de Groovy, the very first Grails company in Spain. Now he works in 4finance as Application Architect. He is a speaker at conferences like Greach, Codemotion Madrid and Rome, GGX London or GR8Conf Copenhagen (http://lanyrd.com/profile/alvaro_sanchez/). He also has wrote several Grails plugins, including Spring Security REST, which provides stateless, RESTful, token based authentication for Grails using OAuth 2 and JWT (http://github.com/alvarosanchez).

An introduction to the Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana stack and our experiences using ELK.
We receive error logs from our production environment and required a tool to deal with the, at times, large amount of error messages. After looking into available log analysis products we chose Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. It's a complete, highly configurable software stack for log processing, and a free, open source alternative to tools like Splunk. Logstash is a tool for processing events and logs. It can be configured through simple configuration files using Ruby dictionary syntax. The configuration files set up a pipeline for how logs should be processed. This allows you to split log messages into separate fields, tag them and add data based on the processing of the log message contents. Logstash integrates with Elasticsearch, a search engine based on Apache Lucene, to store and index the enriched logs. Elasticsearch makes the logs searchable in a modern search engine with data analytics capabilities. Kibana is a web front end for searching and visualizing data available in Elasticsearch. Using Kibana, one can search logs and create graphs and other visualizations of the log contents. We use Logstash to detect patterns in logs, which we use to tag error messages with Jira issue numbers and exception types. Kibana lets us visualize the amount of errors, the kinds of errors that occur and when. The visualizations gives us an easily understandable overview of the problems in the analyzed environment.
Sigmund Hansen recently started working for Computas. He has set up the ELK stack for log processing and is responsible for builds and deployments in one of the larger projects at Computas. At the time of this writing he is working on automating deployment of the system to enable continuous delivery and deployment in the future. Prior to working at Computas, Sigmund worked and studied at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo. He held classes in Data Structures and Algorithms, Semantic Technology and Object-Oriented Programming, and various presentations in subjects like game development, Arduino prototyping and Linux shell usage.

Vulnerability in our applications: is there anything more we can do about it? Should security always be an "afterthought"?
This talk is inspired by the book Future Crimes by Marc Goodman which portrays the exponential growth of the current technological development, and projects the future development and then elaborates their possible exploits and consequences. The ever-growing number of computer screens proliferating in our world, our growing interconnectedness and the ubiquity of inherently vulnerable computing systems (both the “traditional” and the future ones like IoT, AI, etc) imply that this gathering storm of technological insecurity can no longer be ignored. “As things stand today, the engineers, coders, and companies that create today’s technologies have near-zero personal and professional responsibility for the consequences of their actions.” Should security be “merely an afterthought” and an external process? Can security aspects be integrated in the craftsmanship/agile paradigms, and then reflected in the methodologies, practices and tools?
I have been a Java developer for 8 years, involved in various projects with client in the private sectors or the government. I aspire to the values of the software craftsmanship. I recently read the book mentioned in the abstract and got really inspired. I think the issue presented there should not be ignored, it should be integrated in the software craftsmanship paradigm. Honestly, I am not sure I am the right person to present solutions, but I do feel I need to raise awareness of this issue from a developer perspective.

Stream processing, to quote Mugatu, is so hot right now. Come see how Akka Streams is used to create reusable pieces of transfomation pipelines that transparently leverages multicore hardware.
In this presentation we'll explore fast data streaming using Akka Streams—how to design robust transformation pipelines with built-in flow control, able to take advantage of multicore and going over networks. We'll discuss the traditional pitfalls and how they can be overcome as well as explore how we can build reusable pieces of pipeline logic that we can reuse—a smorgasbord of transformations.
Viktor Klang is the Deputy CTO at Typesafe—prolific contributor to the Akka project as well as member of the Reactive Streams SIG when not involved in the Scala Standard Library concurrency APIs. Interested in all things distributed and concurrent—software as hardware.

Java was designed to abstract your hardware, this has come at a cost and thanks to Moore's law we've not noticed. Look a little deeper into your performance however and you'll see the price you're paying for Java's Objects. Turn it into binary though and see order(s) of magnitude better performance from the same code.
There are a lot of advantages to XML. Using XML schema is probably one of the best ways to define a model and messaging standard, but the messages we pass around and store are horribly verbose. For years now, we’ve been binding the XML to Java and working with tools such as JAXB, but they often inflate the in-memory size even further, not to mention the number of objects they create. Incept5 developed a Java XML binding tool with the same API but where the content is stored as a single byte array. So, just one object per message, a fraction of the memory footprint, and at least an order of magnitude more speed than traditional Java binding. Taking XML back to binary means getting big data in memory, and 100 GB of XML in your laptop’s RAM is entirely feasible. Learn more in this session.

Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. We have built that security check into our Jenkins build server. In this presentation we will show you how it works, how to do it, challenges and shortcomings to our suggested solution.
As most conscious software companies, we have a security crew doing pen-tests before releasing to production. However, as the pen-test was very late in the development game this wasn’t very agile and fixing errors this late was an extremely high risk activity. Of course, we could get them to do the pen-test multiple times earlier in the development cycle, but we then of course have to use more time and resources and time and resources cost lots of money. So, our security guys came to us and wondered if we couldn’t build in this type of security within our automated build cycle. Our build server of choice is currently Jenkins, the security guys tools of choice was Burp a java based GUI tool and we did a PoC to make these work together. In this presentation we will share our findings, our code and give you a how to guide to do it yourself. We will also touch some common security issues, a short Burp how-to and some insight on how to interpret the Burp report the tool provides.

More and more computers are used in cars to control everything from satellite navigation to braking to the cruise control. This session will look at how you can use Java to use information from a car along with that of additional sensors to record and playback detailed telemetry from a journey. Whilst a fun session there, there are practical applications for insurance, fleet management and training.
There is significantly more computing power in the average family car today than was used to get the first men to the moon. Pretty much every aspect of a car now uses some form of computing to simplify or enhance these features, from adaptive cruise control to tyre pressure monitoring systems. This session will look at the Carputer that I built using a Raspberry Pi coupled to a range of sensors, as well as an interface to the CAN bus on my car. Having written Java code to collect the data during journeys, I also developed an application to playback data for review later. All aspects of the system will be explained.

This session has one goal: to teach you what hypermedia really is and why it's important. We'll use hypermedia to develop and play a simple yet flexible text adventure that can be modified and extended at runtime without breaking. Just like the Web.
As the Web has shown, hypermedia messages over HTTP is an elegant and flexible way of building applications. The HTTP infrastructure simplifies your application protocol and gives you caching and scalability essentially for free. Hypermedia messages gives you dynamic control over the state transitions in your application, allowing you to grow your application and change things around without breaking clients. These are terrific properties when building any application! In this talk, I'll put these claims to the test as we play, dissect and extend an old-school text adventure game implemented using nothing but HTTP and hypermedia.
Einar has been designing software and programming computers for many years and still thinks it's marvelous that you can get paid to do so. He writes code in admiration and respect of the djinns of the computer and writes obscure technological blog posts whenever he learns something interesting. Part computer scientist, part software engineer and consultant, he thinks that we should focus on ideas, concepts and understanding rather than fads and superstitions.

We designers have been told for ages to learn how to program because we needed to know the technology. On the other hand, very few developers bother doing the same with design. This usually leads to worse results than necessary, and robs us of the opportunity to play on the same team.
This presentation is meant to spark a much needed discussion about how developers and designers can work together to achieve excellence without losing their minds. Attendees should leave the room afterwards with a certain insight in how ignorance hinders best outcomes and how they personally can improve the situation.

The Java debugger is your best friend. But do you know how it works ? We will look at how the JVM and debugger interact in detail to make it such a powerful tool. Finally, we experiment with the same functionality ourselves to achieve things things like: *record stack traces with values * specify NullPointerException cause. Get ready to see a whole range of valuable information about your application open up!
If you are like me, then the debugger is your absolute favourite tool. But how does the Java debugger really work ? For instance, why do some conditional breakpoints severely slow down the code? We will look at how the debugger and the JVM interact to carry out common tasks such as: - breakpoints - stepping - code evaluation - value modification - reference traversal - hot code replacement We will see how the interfaces can be utilised to monitor running systems. Finally, we will experiment with the java debug interface ourselves to improve debugging and capture more precise information: - Record stack frames with values. - specify NullPointerException cause. - live object monitoring Come along to see the power of the Java debugger unleashed.

JCache API (JSR-107) has been released in March 2014. For the first time since the initial release of Java we have a standardized vendor-neutral API for caching. What does it mean for developers and why we should care? Isn't this yet another bloated & hard-to-use abstraction? This talk will introduce concepts and structures JCache is based on. We will show how to deal with differences in underlying implementations, how migrate from existing proprietary caching APIs to JCache and how to avoid common pitfalls.
This talk will reason about why to move away from proprietary Caching implementations and shows common pitfalls people tried to solve over and over again in the last years. It will also feature a live-coding section to introduce the JCache APIs and show some successful examples of how to move onwards to JCache from currently used custom built or proprietary solutions.

You’ve just set up your Kafka cluster and now you are ready to process tens of thousands events per second. You decoupled your architecture and now all the communication goes via pubSub bus and you can focus only on providing business value. It would be great if that can be true. In real life you need to do a lot of tweaks to have your backbone ready to handle all the traffic you want.
In the talk we will focus on the project of redesigning the core event bus of the Allegro auction platform. We will talk issues on all the levels from network to data serialization. After the presentation you will have answers to the questions: How to assure our clients that not even a single event is lost? How to respond in less than 65ms even if Kafka is rebuilding its cluster? ...And many other questions you will face.

This talk is about how you can provide logins for your modern apps and APIs. We'll visit a broad range of related topics, such as OpenID Connect, SAML, multi-factor authentication, password hashing, IdPs, federation and brokering.
Years ago, in the days of 3-tiered architecture, logins where simpler. A basic form with a username and password validated against a users table, or in more advanced cases an LDAP server, was often enough. Today with modern architectures that's no longer the case. These architectures and the fact that everything is exposed on the Internet puts new demands on security. This talk is about how you can provide logins for your modern apps and APIs. We'll visit a broad range of related topics, such as OpenID Connect, SAML, multi-factor authentication, password hashing, IdPs, federation and brokering. Finally, we'll show how you can have all these features in your apps without any coding by using an open source identity and access management solution.

This talk is about integration architectures, and in particular, how to pick the right one for your company. We will talk about what the pluses and minuses of each one are, and how Apache Camel can help you do the heavy lifting in each case.
You are setting out on an integration project. A lot of the documentation that you have found on the net is from vendors, and a good portion of that looks to have been written 10 years ago. ESBs are old hat, right? You have been on Twitter and it's all abuzz with microservices and Docker containers. Wouldn't it just be easier to hand-craft a couple of point-to-point integrations and glue them inside your web app? This talk will clear the fog and outline your options as they appear today. We will then discuss how to select the one most likely to succeed in your organization through the application of Conway's Law (one size does not fit all). We will discuss the non-functional requirements that any set of integrations should consider and how they can be applied to each option. We will then outline the Apache Camel open source integration framework, what it and its tooling ecosystem bring to the party, and how it can be applied in each instance to reduce your workload, so that you and your team can focus on the functional and non-functional problems of integration today.

In a world of "continuous everything" each discipline within the industry has to find ways to provide value fast and reliably. Business people need to be able to adapt to an ever changing world, developers need to deliver software many times per day, and operations need to provide high availability infrastructure at an instant. How does security integrate into this work stream?
Reviewing every code change quickly becomes impractical. Integrating security tools into the development and security cycles is hard when you need to focus on security without introducing any noise. Automation as close as possible to when code is written is key to prevent vulnerabilities before they are shipped. But how does one go about automating security? And even when you have done your best effort of not introducing vulnerabilities into production you are only half way. Development, Test and QA are not hostile environments when it comes to security. The real test only happens after you have hit Production. In this talk we will present experiences with security work on a team delivering continuously. We will also explain the state of continuous delivery and how this affects working with security together with some recommendations for the future.

Everyone's doing Stream Processing these days. During last 5 years there's been more CEP engines released than Web Frameworks. This is a great pattern, but without Functional Programming concepts you're just touching a surface. How to make your streams immutable, composable and reusable, and why many out-of-the-box distributions are limiting your basically endless opportunities.
Stateful streams is a current state-of-art. Although much too often state makes the Stream less composable and performant. People are using stores such as Redis to store the intermediate state, and never think about better ways to make state available for every worker. With currently existing single-box RX Frameworks and Message Queues it's possible to build Streams in ways that entirely change the perspective and thinking about the stream, taking complexity out and letting developers think about each entity in a stream as an isolated event, allowing better composition and testability.

Join me for some ranting about how best practices from open source development and project management school is making your sustaining team miserable
I dare say most projects start off with a goal of producing code that is easy to maintain for the sustaining crew. But as developers are too often split into either pure development teams or pure sustaining teams, not many in the development teams get to experience what sustaining is actually like. Many seemingly good ideas that are great in the developing phase, make life more difficult in sustaining. Many things that are essential for a good library or framework, are harmful when applied to application development. I want to share some concrete examples and hopefully inspire you all to write applications that is easier for others to work with.
I've been programming for money for 15 years now in all sorts of environments. Done both sustaining work and greenfield development. I like making things, and making things better. I also enjoy making people think, question their beliefs, not just follow authorities, but figure things out for themselves.

Taking photos of the night sky requires accurate control to track the stars. Controlling a telescope from my pc made me wander into the realms outside the JVM, and into the world of OS and processor specific libraries and connections. Or “write some times, run somewhere”.
When I started using Java, I tried to stay within the 100% java paradigm to make sure that my software would truly be “write once, run anywhere”. Native code was blasphemy. My world consisted of a keyboard, a mouse, a screen and the net. On the net were databases and everything else. A few years back, I started on a hobby project where I needed to break out of the JVM and talk to something that didn’t speak to java. I needed to communicate with the hardware of a webcamera and an embedded platform. All of this to make software that would keep my telescope tracking the night sky with extreme precision. And it was still portable. Sort of. Using good ol’e SOLID principles. I will give a short precentation on the what, why and how of making the system work.

We have been using Java 8 in production for over a year now and would like to share some of our experiences and best practices. Java 8 helps us to adopt a more functional style in our programs, and this talk will discuss how to write code that is both elegant, readable and efficient.
During the talk I will be going in depth on some of the new language features in Java 8, and also touch on some nice additional utilities. Some of the topics include: - Lambdas vs. Method Handles - Streams + Optional = true? - parallelStream FTW? - To mutate or not to mutate
Fredrik works as a software developer and consultant at Iterate. His main interest currently is functional programming and in particluar how to apply this in his daily job as a Java developer. The last year he's been happily rewriting code to a more functional style in Java 8. He's held training courses in Scala and dabbled in Clojure, and likes to speak at conferences.

You will learn how profiling tools work and whether you should trust their suggestions or not.
To troubleshoot a devious performance issue or understand the performance characteristics of an application, developers like to use profilers. But what do those numbers they produce actually mean? Are they accurate? How does a profiler actually measure them? What are potential sources of error? Can you compare those numbers with coworkers’? Is it possible to do anything useful with the produced results? This session provides answers to these questions. You will learn how to judge results produced by profilers, find out about the basic measurement techniques of profilers, and learn how to configure them correctly. The presentation shows many problems in live coding examples. Everything mentioned in the session is applicable to any tool.

This talk outlines the key capabilities of the Java EE platform and introduces the audience to additional frameworks and concepts which do help by implementing all kinds of security requirements in Java EE based applications.
Security in applications is a never-ending story. Most of the knowledge about how to build secure applications is derived from knowledge and experience. And we've all done the same mistakes every Java EE developer does over and over again. But how to solve the real business requirements behind access and authorization with Java EE? Can I have a 15k rights matrix? Does that perform? How to secure the transport layer? How does session binding works? Can I implement 2-Factor-Authentication? And what about social integrations? This talk outlines the key capabilities of the Java EE platform and introduces the audience to additional frameworks and concepts which do help by implementing all kinds of security requirements in Java EE based applications.

An Introductory session to Eclipse's successful language development environment. Xtext let's you build fully featured programming languages as well as simple domain specific languages (DSL). The first half of this session will give an overview of what Xtext can do for you. During the second half we will develop a DSL live and from scratch!
A well designed DSL (domain specific language) can be a huge productivity boost in many scenarios. Being it a special language for describing technical things like services or data structures or something more business oriented such as a DSL for describing complex financial products. But to make development of a custom language worthwile it must be easy to define and maintain such a DSL and of course the users must have assistance through tool support. Xtext provides a set of APIs and DSLs to develop such DSLs easily. It not only gives you a generated parser but supports the full stack of infrastruture that is needed. This also includes editor support for Eclipse, IntelliJ and Web as well as integration with the common build tools Maven, Gradle, and Ant. Xtext is an Eclipse.org project and as such available as open-source. The framework is actively developed, very mature and widely used in industry and research. In this session you will first get a brief introduction into the main concepts of Xtext. After that we will build a DSL from scratch.
Sven Efftinge is the project lead of Xtext, a framework for developing programming languages and domain-specific languages. Sven works as development manager for itemis.

In this session we'll talk about monad concept and build an instance of monad from scratch. There are hundreds of tutorial that explain monads, but we'll take a practical problem first approach. Building a monad, then explaining the laws of monads and why they exist is a good way to ogranise your mental picture of when monads are useful. Recognising monadic code and its properties is paramount in our era of coming to functional programming.
This code-heavy session demystifies what monads are and outlines reasons why you would even want to introduce them into your code. We’ll take a look at the traditional definition for monads and offer a corresponding type definition in Java. We’ve selected a sample Java 8 implementation of a ‘Promise’ monad, which represents the result of async computation to help us answer practical questions about monads. Also, we'll go over the Laws of Monads and show that you can have a proper monad in Java, if you are brave enough to allow the underlying platform change the rules a bit. PS. You won’t be penalised or ridiculed during this session for your (lack of) Haskell knowledge!

Think your code is running? Think Again!
When we think about out application running we tend to think of lines of code following each other as the machine obeys our script, the reality is somewhat different. In this talk we'll have a look at the gap between the lines, where surprising amounts of time can be spent, some of the topics covered: * Placing the Java program on the stack: HW/OS/Process * Open to interpretation: from your code to assembly * When the JVM stops (and the promise of a "pause free JVM") * The pause button: Safepoints in your code * Object Reference accounting: Store and Load access barriers in your code

Why do even proponents of statical typing pick on Java's type system? We will have a look at the most common criticisms and look at what exists “on the other side of the fence”. Does a more advanced type system really make the grass greener?
Proponents of dynamically typed languages often criticize type systems such as Java's, but – more puzzlingly – programmers advocating static type systems also regularly pick on Java for delivering too few benefits compared to the amount of work you – the programmer – put in by sprinkling noisy type declarations all over your code. What are the actual shortcomings of Java's type system, and how is it compared to languages with more advanced type systems such as Scala, F#, OCaml and Haskell? We will use the characteristics of Java's type system and its history as a guide to explore types in other languages. How can other languages get even more type safety – sometimes without having to use any type declarations at all? Is there a hidden cost somewhere? We will look at some scary-sounding concepts such as “generalized algebraic datatypes”, “higher-kinded types” and “higher-ranked polymorphism” and see if they really can be leveraged by us normal, non-wizard programmers for a tangible benefit.
Erlend Hamberg started a on computer engineering degree to learn about systems programming and hardware, but veered slightly off course and ended up with a degree in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence.

WebRTC is one of the most substantial things to happen to cross-platform networking in later years. This talk gives you an introduction to WebRTC in native apps on Android, which will make your app capable of sending audio, video and data directly between peers on Android, iOS and browsers.
WebRTC allows you to do low-latency, peer to peer data transfer on all major platforms today. However, very few have yet to take advantage of that fact in their native apps. Transferring files over the local wifi between Android and a browser, creating the next video messaging platform, peer to peer multiplayer for your mobile game, or streaming huge chunks of sensory data from your IoT farm? Everything is easy with WebRTC. WebRTC is not only for browsers, and this talk will walk you through the basic concepts and show you how to get started, allowing you to build WebRTC capable native applications on Android for your next project.

Attend this session if you want to quickly kickstart your understanding of the entire JavaScript ecosystem in the space of an hour!
While the Java language and Java EE platform are clearly defined and specified, that is not the case for the JavaScript ecosystem. It seems like whenever you wake up in the morning there's a new JavaScript framework that supersedes the one you've been getting comfortable with. Geertjan Wielenga has years of experience in the Java ecosystem and has in recent years gained experience with the new JavaScript frameworks, technologies, and tools. He is writing a book about it with the intention to help Java EE developers in integrating and using relevant parts of the JavaScript platform. Come to this interactive and code-driven session and learn how and when and under which circumstances it may be useful to combine the JavaScript world with Java EE applications, with an overview of the JavaScript landscape and insights on how to best use them within the context of the Java EE platform.

NetCom is deploying its next generation webshop and self-service portals which are modern HTML/JavaScript applications that run entirely in the browser. To support this type of architecture, we designed a set of REST APIs, to be exposed to the Internet, which needed to be secure, front-end developer friendly and fast.
Most of our existing APIs were SOAP/XML based, hard to use and hidden behind firewalls. Now we needed to make backend services available on the Internet such that they can be called directly from the browser. This gave us a chance to replace legacy APIs with new RESTful APIs which we could use both internally and expose publicly as well, potentially to third party developers. In this session we want to share our experience of building solid APIs using plain Java and Spring MVC. Do REST APIs really need to be hypermedia driven (HATEOAS) to be cool? How to solve API versioning in Spring MVC? Can we generate accurate documentation directly from the source ensuring it is always up to date? How can we ensure reliability? How to model asynchronous execution? If those challenging API design problems interest you, then this session is for you.

Based on practical experience of creating an application composed of multiple microservices, this talk is about the challenges developers and testers face when creating an application in this manner.
Traditional applications often deploy as a single unit, or as a client and a server. Splitting such an application into a significantly larger number of independent microservice processes creates new opportunities and some new challenges. This talk presents some of the issues developers and testers will be facing in such an architecture, and revisits some classic problems like build modularization and code design in context of the microservice paradigm. While everything is definitely not same/same, it's definitely not all different.

How we changed full release and deploy from half a day, to half an hour, to 8 minutes using Gradle.
Deployment pipelines is an excellent way of continous delivery. It gives a brilliant visibility to every step needed for an application to reach production. Alas, not always so easy to implement in real life. The presentation will teach you how we used Gradle together with Jenkins Build Pipeline plugin to drastically cut time on a full release and deploy of a large Maven Scala application. The presentation will show you some great benefits Gradle has over Maven and how to use these to make every build in Jenkins a potential release candidate.

Elasticsearch unites text search and statistical analysis into a powerful data analytics pack. This presentation shows how to put the product catalogue from Vinmonopolet into Elasticsearch using Logstash. Using Kibana for visual display and search, we will try to find the the best value for money beer, and the maximum amount of belgianness.
Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana come together as a great set of tools for gaining insights into data. The talk will go through the process from gathering data with Logstash, fixing data input, metadata enrichment using Kimonolabs and Untappd, investigating, exploring and creating visualizations in Kibana. Text search is used together with aggregation queries to drill down in data. The talk builds loosely upon this blog post: http://blog.comperiosearch.com/blog/2015/02/09/kibana-4-beer-analytics-engine/ Using Elasticsearch 2.0 beta and Kibana 4.2

If you want to learn about token-based stateless authentication in REST services, this session is for you. You will learn why stateless authentication simplifies your development and we will introduce you to Json Web Tokens (JWT). We are going to pay attention to best practices for handling JWT and what security details and possible tradeoffs you may take into consideration before start coding.
These days almost all projects uses some form of REST architecture to expose resources to their clients (browser, mobile, ...). One of most important points are to secure your endpoints; authenticate users and identify them inside the system. When we think of REST security we might think about protocols such as Oauth, ClientID or SAML. But the question is; do we need these protocols in all cases or could we get away with a simpler method that is still to be considered secure and attack proof? Come to this session to learn; how the Json Web Token(JWT) standard can simplify your authentication model while maintaining high security, and the advantages of using JWT from a developers point of view. This session is an introduction to JWT. No "master of the security universe" prerequisite required to benefit from this session.

Java 8 makes significant changes to the JVM memory model which are important to understand when running a high scale production environment. The first half of this session will cover the basics of Java memory and garbage collection including changes introduced by Java 8. The second half of this session will address the increased the consequence of running a production JVM inside a container environment which is an increasingly common scenario for micro service architectures involving docker.
This session will cover in details the concepts and tooling necessary to understand and manage Java 8 JVM in a productions environment. We will start with memory basics; the stack and the heap. The session will cover Java 8's Metaspace and changes in "perm". The information will be useful to developers as well as ops teams. The session will then dive into garbage collectors comparing differences between java 7 and java 8 for each of; oldParallelGC, CMS and G1. Memory, Thread and JMX tool demonstrations are included to help bring with comprehension. The last portion of the session we will cover details of linux memory and cpu management with cgroups. The session will highlight the difference between cpu sets and cpu shares with a focus on cpu shares (which is the default for most container technologies such as Docker). This session will walk through the consequences of deploying Java in a container and discuss how to manage it.

This presentation will give a hands on introduction to the many possibilities Elasticsearch offers in terms of lightning fast data analytics and aggregations, beyond traditional search.
This session will go through various case studies for statistical data analytics. The presentation will aim to demonstrate how we can navigate, aggregate and visualise structured and unstructured data for analytical purposes. We will look at case studies that go far beyond traditional full-text-search, and hopefully see that Elasticsearch can help us unlock the true value of our data.

Software has evolved so much that singlethreaded programs are rarely enough now. In this talks we'll cover several approaches to organising your concurrent Java code: from managing threads to actor frameworks, to software transactional memory.
Writing concurrent code that is also correct is unbelievably hard. Naturally, humanity has developed a number of approaches to handle concurrency in the code, starting from basic threads that follow the hardware way to do concurrency to higher level primitives like fibers and work-stealing solutions. But which approach is the best for you? In this session, we'll take a look at a simple concurrent problem and solve it using different ways to manage concurrency: threads, executors, actors, fibers, monadic code with completable futures. All these approaches are different from the simplicity, readability, configuration and management point of view. Some scenarios are better modelled with threads, while sometimes you're better off with actors. We'll discuss the benefits of each approach and figure out when it's worth pursuing in your project.

Learn how to develop event-driven microservices using domain models based on event sourcing.
Event sourcing persists each entity as a sequence of state changing event. An entity’s current state is derived by replaying the events. Event sourcing is a great way to implement event-driven micro services. When one service updates an entity, the new events are consumed by other services, which then update their own state. In this talk we describe how to implement business logic using a domain model that is based on event sourcing. You will learn how to write functional, immutable domain models in Scala. We will compare and contrast a hybrid OO/FP design with a purely functional approach. You will learn how Domain Driven Design concepts such as bounded contexts and aggregates fit in with event-driven microservices.

It describes some of the architectural choices you have to make for frontend when you're splitting up your services, and suggests some things you can do with your services to make your frontend developers hate you a little less.
Microservices are rapidly developing as the new standard for building scalable and maintainable systems. This brings with it a new set of challenges for building frontends which now have to collate data from more sources than before without growing into the monoliths they mean to replace. There are many things you can do to make frontend development easier, ranging from your choice of protocol to how you plan to do authorization. I'll go through some of the pitfalls we've met at FINN.no, and look at some good and some bad solutions. I'll also try to give some advice on how to design your APIs in a way that will serve the needs of your users with the minimal amount of noise and confusion.
Haakon has been a Java developer since 2010, and in all this time he's never written a single Enterprise Java Bean. Instead he's been lucky enough to work on Android and GUI applications, currently for FINN.no, and previously Cisco. Before working as a frontend developer, worked for several years as a Unix sysadmin, and has lately started to look into into those fiddly bits which sit in between the OS and the GUI (a.k.a. the back end).

This talk is giving a good overview of the related Web tier enhancements planned for Java EE 8, namely Servlet 4.0 and HTTP/2 support, a brand-new MVC framework, support for SSE, etc.
With the introduction of Web Socket, JSON-P and the various enhancements on JAX-RS (e.g. JAX-RS Client API) HTML 5 support was one of the key themes of Java EE 7. Java EE 8 will continue to build on that and improve the support for writing and deploying HTML 5 based application. This session will look in details at some of the Web related enhancements planned in Java EE 8 such as - Servlet 4.0 and HTTP/2 support - Addition of a new Action-Based MVC framework - Support for SSE (Server-Sent Event) in JAX-RS - Improvements around JSON-P and the addition of a new JSON binding API, i.e. JSON-B. - etc. This session will be illustrated with some demos using the early Reference Implementation builds of some of those brand new APIs.

Most people are familiar with the concept of code coverage. Some people use it as a tool while developing, others use it as a metric to gauge where they are at. There is a better tool and a better metric.
Until a few years ago most people hadn't heard of mutation testing. Now it's in daily use by teams working in domains ranging from tractor sales, insurance and banking through to advanced bio tech and the control systems for the large hadron collider at CERN. In this workshop we'll introduce the concept of mutation testing and, through exercises, demonstrate how the open source http://pitest.org tool can be used to give valuable feedback during development.

What is the fashion today within the Java world. Do we need it? How should we use it? What are the consequences?
With new projects we want to use the latest products and may wish to try out one of the latest frameworks. What are the consequences of such a decision? How are we going to implement this in existing code? What is the cost?
I am developer working for SopraSteria. In recent years, I have been working for different customers with maintenance of Java legacy systems. I enjoy finding out how things work and why systems fail.

Ever wanted to try implemeting a programming language from scratch? Doing so can be an educational experience, and it's much easier than you might think. We will guide you through the hoops of creating a small, but neat, programming language.
The workshop will guide you through the process of creating your language using a hands-on TDD approach. By the end of the workshop you will be the proud author of a programming language, and will hopefully have a better understanding of programming languages. The goal is for you to make a relatively simple language, with the following features: a handful of datatypes (integers, booleans, and symbols), variables, and first class functions (with lexical scoping). We plan to provide the test suits in both Python and Java, so you are free to choose which one you prefer. For more practical info, visit http://diy-lisp.com.

Use git pull-requests as review tools to break the knowledge silos that develops in a team of developers
In theory, all team members in SCRUM and Kanban should be almost equal in their knowledge of a given product. In reality, you get silos of knowledge, where certain team members are experts on certain part of the program, and which the team is dependent on to work on that part. I want to show that using tools like git pull-requests, you can make code reviews a part that not only enhances the code quality but also breaks these silos by spreading the knowledge around the team.

If you are ever asked to convert, process and scale millions of real-world images using Java it will be a painful experience - at least it was for me. I came across unexpected problems ranging from CMYK color models, alpha-channel handling, multi-page TIFF, image compression algorithms, setting DPIs, PDF preview generation, decompression bombs to efficient image scaling. In hindsight I wished there was some single resource of information to guide me through my problems - and this is exactly the reason for this presentation. It provides real-life experience in replacing an ImageMagick/JMagick image conversion & scaling with a pure Java implementation covering Apache PDFBox, Java Advanced Imaging (JAI), TwelveMonkeys ImageIO plugins, Sanselan (aka Commons Imaging) and different Java-based image-scaling libraries.
Image processing in Java, using ImageIO & Java Advanced Imaging API (JAI) can seem a simple task when converting only few images. It becomes increasingly difficult when handling millions of user-supplied images and image data found in "the wild", due to terms like alpha-channels, Exif, TIFF support, CMYK, ICC color profiles, JPEG compression flavours, decompression bombs and performance considerations. And, surprisingly, information on how to solve and overcome many of these issues were hard to find. This presentation discusses the problems encountered when replacing a legacy ImageMagick-based solution for creating image previews and thumbnails with a Java-based solution using ImageIO, JAI & Apache PDFBox, introduces the TwelveMonkeys ImageIO library and shows how image processing in Java can be fun again.

Immutable data structures will help you regain your sanity when programming - even in JavaScript! In this talk I will explain what immutability is, what it's good for, and how to effectively put it to use in JavaScript. We will see how immutability can truly help reduce complexity in the UI layer, and even improve performance while we're at it. Immutability goes hand in hand with functional programming, but it doesn't have to - no matter what your pereferred programming paradigm is, immutability will improve your code. If reducing complexity is your cup of tea, this talk is for you.
While the JavaScript standardization committee is coming up with APIs to observe mutations (Object.observe) in order to help improve UI rendering performance, the community around React and ClojureScript has turned to immutability to reduce the problem to managing a single reference. The result is unprecedented performance AND a greatly simplified programming model. In this talk I will walk the audience through what immutable data are, why they reduce complexity, how they can aid in improving performance (in spite of worsening performance at a macro level) and most importantly: how to put immutability to work in JavaScript in the browser.

Functional programming has been a growing interest the past years, and after some time with the wonderful world of Clojure and its immutable data types, he realized there was no going back.

Are you developing applications that communicate over a network? Of course you are! This talk will take you through all the ways you can build fault-tolerant applications and how, once you get your team in the mindset that everything will eventually fail, dealing with the failures gracefully is no more work than building fragile applications. A big emphasis of this talk is how to re-create issues often only found in production in development and test environments, such as slow networks and lost packets.
So you want to build fault tolerant systems? A big emphasis of this talk is how to re-create issues often only found in production in development and test environments, such as slow networks and lost packets. The topics covered will be: - What to do when one of the dependencies fails to respond in time - When to use network level time outs vs application level timeouts - What to monitor and how to monitor it, e.g connection pools, thread pools, queue sizes, latency - How to test for when the network is slow or saturated - How to test for when traffic is lost in transit - How to train your stakeholders to expect failure and get them to agree to fallbacks meaning they can choose availability over other requirements - When to use automated circuit breakers vs manual kill switches - Tips, hints and tricks for doing all of the above in Java The topics covered are especially relevant if your application has a lot of dependencies that it communicates with over a network i.e. microservices. It is even more applicable if your application is deployed to an environment which is prone to failure e.g. a "cloud". With supporting powerpoint slides, I'll cover the theory and motivation behind moving to a more distributed architecture and then go through the pitfalls and the strategies for improving fault-tolerance, backed up with real examples from the system I built at BSkyB.

Java 8 is finally here giving us access to a variety of long awaited new features and functionalities. Lambda expressions and Stream API has empowered Java in areas that are of great relevance to Big Data, providing an expressive language to operate over complex data structures, making the transformation and analysis of data more convenient, scalable and efficient. In this hands-on session, we will demonstrate how Java 8 Streams programming model in conjunctions with lambdas can be realized in an extensible set of distributed compute engines such as Spark, Tez, Flink etc., giving developer a unified programming model who's core features are part of the JDK itself.

What do you need to know about if you want (or more likely are forced) to work with front end development these days? In this presentation I will give an introduction and an overview of the modern web developers toolbox.
The world has changed much over the last ten years. Back in 2008 you either used PHP, CSS and JavaScript or you would use Java with JSP or JSF. In the Java world, front-end was considered easy to learn but difficult to get right. It was just something you hacked and got working - like frosting on a cake. Today the world is quite different. Now you use bundlers, test frameworks, linters, transpilers, minification, preprocessors, automation, dependency management. Come and learn why these tools are part of a modern web developer toolbox. Discover that front end has become a rich, professional and complex industry.

The classes of the Java Collections Framework belong to the most used part of the JDK. But can the offered list implementations really be used for all purposes? The most used class ArrayList has not only a minimalistic API but also serious performance weaknesses. The first part of the session therefore introduces alternative implementations which excel in all kind of uses. In the second part, key collections are presented as toolbox to increase not only application but also development performance.
The first part of the session introduces collections which addresses the shortcomings of the JDK list implementation. - GapList is a drop-in replacement for ArrayList which offers efficient access per index and efficient adding/removing at begin/end of the list at the same time. Further performance improvement is realized through exploiting the locality of reference. - BigList is specially designed to handle real large collections (where large means that it still fits into the heap). It stores data in distinct blocks which are maintained in a specialized tree structure and uses copy-on-write functionality to efficiently copy list of all sizes. It is shown how these classes are implemented in detail and benchmarks prove that they outperform other known implementations regarding performance and memory usage. The second part of the session introduces key collections. They add the functionality of keys and constraints to Java collections as known from relational databases. This unique approach allows to define concise data models with just a few lines of code which boosts not only application but also development performance.

Dynamic languages are all the hype these days. In this context, Java - a strictly typed language - can sometimes appear to be overly restrictive. However, using runtime code generation, it is possible to avoid Java's strict type system when it seems necessary and preserve it when types help us to avoid programming errors.
While Java's strict type system is a great help for avoiding programming errors, it also takes away some of the flexibility that developers appreciate when using dynamic languages. By using runtime code generation, it is possible to bring back some of this flexibility back to the Java virtual machine. For this reason, runtime code generation is used by many state-of-the-art Java frameworks for implementing POJO-centric APIs but it also opens the door for assembling more modular applications. This presentation offers an introduction to the complex of runtime code generation and its use on the Java platform. Furthermore, it discusses the up- and downsides of several code generation libraries such as ASM, Javassist, cglib and Byte Buddy.

"The Monoliths days are numbered", so the saying goes. And building Microservices for the Cloud is easy, right? Are Microservices really something new and different, or is it just SOA as it was intended to be? And if so, can we manage to avoid the traps of yet another failed SOA? This talk is about distributed computing, why it matters, and why you need to care when developing your systems this way. Come to hear about what you should harness, what you should fear, and learn about the anti-patterns that are beginning to emerge that deserve their own special place in hell.
Microservices is the new popular kid on the block. Crowd pleaser at many conferences. With popular poster childs like Netflix and Amazon it seems to be the killer approach to 21st century architectures, right? But is this stuff only for Hollywood Coders pioneering on the bleeding edge of our profession? Or is this stuff ready to be used for your projects and your customers? This presentation is a warning. Microservices don't fix broken organizations and distributed computing is still hard. I will go over the benefits, but more so the pitfalls, of using a Microservices based architecture. What impact does it have on your applications, on dealing with scale and failures and how do you prevent your systems landscape from becoming an unmaintainable nightmare.

Learn about the role of product management, what the expectations are for the role, and what a 'typical' day looks like in the role of a product manager
Think that you can make everyone happy, all of the time? Looking for a challenge that covers everything from design to business to code? Just wondering what the heck it is that a product manager is supposed to do for the team? Come learn what this dark art covers and what the different aspects are of being a success in this position. Using the Martin Eriksson definition of a product manager, we'll dive into each of the competency areas - tech, business, and design - that a product manager needs to master. By reviewing a combination of industry and personal stories, we'll evaluate these different areas for the types of hard skills (e.g. juggling chainsaw requirements, negotiating wild goose chases, expectation lion taming...) needed for flourishing in this role. Finally, we'll take a look at how these are used in a day to day environment in trying to please the varying stakeholders that a product manager encounters. Covering the range from expectation management of the business to reading through API docs to understand the limitations of third party services being pitched to developers, this section takes a look at who wants what on a regular basis. Come for the magic of product management, stay for the reality tv show of getting things built!

Imagine a culture where the input of the whole organization turns an individual idea into a user story in just a couple of hours, where everybody's goal is to write great code, make the customer’s job easier, and where you work on projects you love instead of loathe. Key ingredients include quarterly hackathons, bringing autonomous teams together and ‘openness by default.’
A great coding culture concentrates on making developers productive and happy by removing unnecessary overhead, bringing autonomous teams together, helping the individual programmer to innovate, and raising awareness among developers about how to create better code. I will talk about how to establish and foster a strong engineering-focused culture that scales from a small team to a huge organization with hundreds of developers. I'll give lots of examples from our experience at Atlassian to show that once you're working in a great coding culture, you won't want to work anywhere else.

Diving into the wonders of Angular 2 and writing elegant TypeScript code.
When TypeScript was first announced 3 years ago, it was met with skepticism within the JavaScript community. Questions such as; "Do we really need this thing by Microsoft?" were raised, and according to statistics at the time the JavaScript superset was not used by many front-end developers. This would take a dramatic 360 degree turn. Fast forward to the present time. Google's Angular team announces that their AtScript language has been TypeScript all along and the much anticipated Angular 2, will be officially built on TypeScript. The collaboration between the Angular and TypeScript teams has never been this strong! Join me in this session where will dive into the new Angular 2 and write elegant TypeScript code.

This talk presents a number of conceptual and technical challenges that we discovered while building JRebel. JRebel performs class reloading and framework integrations which the JVM doesn't provide out the box. This session demystifies the magic.
This talk presents a number of conceptual and technical challenges that we discovered while building JRebel. At first, the JVM wasn't designed for live updates, so we will talk about the engine that mitigates the problem. Secondly, the diversity of Java ecosystem, created by the variety of application servers, the frameworks and tools, makes it challenging in creating a generic solution that would fit the majority of developers. We will see, how Java platform itself allows us to develop a solution by applying bytecode instrumentation mechanism. JRebel does live code reloading to ensure that the developer can keep instantly alternating between the developing environment and the web browser, to save wasted time and increase the productivity flow.

As mobile oriented standards for the web emerge, you can in an increasing number of situations can replace a native mobile app with a web application. With Chrome 42, Google has closed the two most significant remaining gaps. In this hands-on talk, we will examine some of the web standards which aim to make more mobile oriented web applications and how you can create a web mobile application today.
Many people are surprised by the number of features that are normally associated with mobile development which can be accessed in a mobile web application or indeed in a desktop web application. For a long time, camera and location services have been available. With new standards that have been released to production in 2015, two of the most significant improvements have also been made available to a huge number of browsers: The ability to push notifications to your application even when it's not running and the ability to create a wallpaper shortcut to the web application. In this practically oriented talk, we will show the technical details of making web applications which feels like a native application.

This session will provide the opportunity to use the new features of JDK8, Lambdas and Streams in a practical class. There will be a series of exercises, gradually increasing in difficulty, which will show you how to use a functional style of programming with JDK8.
Lambda expressions and the Streams API provide, for the first time in Java, a way to write functional style code. Learning to use these features effectively requires developers to think differently, moving away from external loops and explicit state to using a pipeline of stateless operations. This hands-on lab will provide a series of exercises that will lead you through many of the new features and APIs in JDK8 that use these exciting new features. The exercises gradually increase in complexity. See how far you get before the time runs out!

With modularity coming to the core Java platform in Java 9, are all our modularity needs fulfilled, or does it still make sense to use something like OSGi? In this talk you will learn how Jigsaw helps modularity, and in what cases it might fall short.
Java 9 will provide a module-system, called Jigsaw. Besides modularising the JDK itself, Java developers can build more modular applications with Jigsaw. Modularity and Java go back way longer, though. OSGi, the de facto standard for modularity in Java has been around since 2000. Adoption is increasing in recent years. A modular architecture has many advantages, such as increased decoupling resulting in more flexibility. In that sense, native support for Java modularity is very welcome. The big question now is: does Java 9 provide everything you need to build truly modular applications? Since Java 9 needs to maintain backwards compatibility, some compromises need to be made while enforcing module boundaries. This talk discusses what you really need to build modular applications. We'll investigate which requirements are met (or not) by both module systems. You'll see that both Jigsaw and OSGi provided pieces of the modularity puzzle. Also, you'll learn whether having an additional modular runtime such as OSGi on top of Java 9 still makes sense.

This talk introduces Easy Batch: a lightweight framework to do batch processing with Java easily
Batch processing with Java has been dominated for many years by the popular Spring Batch framework. In Java EE 7, a new Batch API (JSR352), heavily inspired by Spring Batch's concepts, has been introduced. Today, Spring Batch and the Java EE Batch API are the main solutions to develop batch applications in Java. Both solutions are robust and powerful. But with power comes complexity and many people are complaining about the complexity, overhead and learning curve that these frameworks introduce. The main motivation of Easy Batch is to provide an alternative solution that would be lightweight, easy to learn and use. The idea behind the framework is to take care of all the boilerplate code that is needed to process data in batch mode (data filtering, parsing, mapping to domain objects, validation, etc..) while letting the developer focus on the business logic of his application. Using Easy Batch tremendously reduces the application's code (and hence time to market) and makes it more readable, reusable and maintainable.

In this age when parallelism matters, being able to write proper concurrent code is paramount. While Java hides lots of implementation details by its 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' motto, all abstractions will eventually leak. When they do, you will have to go deeper and see how that thing actually works.
In this talk, we will go deeper into the HotSpot sources and beyond to realize why JMM is the way it is and how to wield it for greater results. We shall take a simple pience of multi-threaded code, and go all the way down to the level of CPU instructions to see what really happens.
See the talk "The Mystery Lies In Your Mind, Not In HotSpot"

To achieve new insights within your company you don't necessarily have to accumulate and crunch a lot of new tracking and tracing data - much key information already exists in disconnected data silos, stored in different databases and systems. By bringing the relevant pieces together in a single place and connecting the pieces of the puzzle at the right points you can gain new insights into your existing data and business.
Graph databases offer the unique opportunity to easily cross-reference and connect disparate, variably structured datasets from many sources in a single place. It is then available for ad-hoc querying and exploration as well as strategic decision making. As a graph is a flexible and malleable data structure, it can evolve as you add new datasets or draw new connections from the insights or assumptions gained. This source of decision making will not be your old-school MDM data cemetery, but a flexible instrument that you can use, reuse, discard and recreate for different goals and purposes. Getting the data into the graph is only one interesting side of the coin, the other similarly challenging one is how to make the freshly spun web of knowledge available for different types of users. Technical users have it easy - they can yield Cypher, a powerful graph query language for arbitrary graph pattern matching, filtering, projection and aggregation of relevant data. For non-technical users a variety of tools and toolkits are available that use the inherent structures and meta information of the graph (labels, types, relationships and properties) to provide visual or natural language interaction to drill down, look at interesting facets, connect and correlate interesting information. Under the hood those tools use the same graph query language to do their job. This talk will cover both aspects of this exciting opportunity. We'll look at how to aggregate, import and connect information from disparate data-sources into a dynamic, flexible graph model and the means, tools and techniques for graph search and discovery on top of that fabric. The tools we use are the graph database Neo4j, its query language Cypher which also provides comprehensive import and data transformation abilities, as well as several tools and libraries from the Neo4j ecosystem to provide visual and textual graph search and exploration.
Michael Hunger has been passionate about software development for a very long time. For the last few years he has been working with Neo Technology on the open source Neo4j graph database.

The container abstraction hit the collective developer mind with great force the past two years and created a space of innovation for the distribution, configuration and deployment of cloud based applications. Now that this new model has established itself, work is moving towards orchestration and coordination of loosely coupled network services. There is an explosion of tools in this arena at different degrees of stability but the momentum is huge. In this session we'll cover an overview of the orchestration landscape - Kubernetes, Mesos, Helios, etc. -, give an introduction to Docker's own orchestration tools - machine, swarm and compose - and show a (semi)live demo of how they work in practice.

Building Microservice Architectures describes this architectural style, as exemplified by Netflix and Amazon, as the first post-DevOps revolution architecture. This session describes context, what problem are we solving, characteristics of microservice architectures, and engineering practices.
Inspired by success stories from companies such as Amazon and Netflix, many organizations are moving towards microservice architectures at a brisk pace. This style of architecture is important because it’s the first architecture to fully embrace the Continuous Delivery and DevOps revolutions. In this session, I cover the motivations for building a microservice architecture (including making the distinction between “regular SOA” and microservices), some considerations you must make before starting (such as transactions versus eventual consistency), how to determine service partition boundaries, and ten tips to dowse you towards success. I also discuss the role of polyglot development, enterprise governance, how data and databases fit into this new world, and tooling to help ensure consistency between core services like logging and monitoring. This session provides a thorough overview of the pros and cons for microservice architectures, when it is applicable, and some nascent best practices.

The EcmaScript 2015 spec - that's the biggest upgrade to the JavaScript language ever - was finalized this summer. Many of the new features are already available in many browsers, and made available by an even wider range of transpilers, frameworks and other tools. ES2015 (aka ES6) does not disappoint - it adds new useful features, and in true JavaScript style, some new WTFs are thrown in for good measure as well. In this talk I'll take you on a tour of the JavaScript of tomorrow (or today, if you don't mind a compiler) and show you what a wonderful (and terrifying) world it is.
I will walk through the most interesting features of EcmaScript 2015/6, show which old JavaScript features you can now safely forget, and spice it all up with some weird gotchas introduced by the language upgrade.

As a former member of the Formula Student team from NTNU, Revolve NTNU, I will talk about our experiences using WebSockets to provide real-time telemetry to connected clients running on mobile platforms or in a web browser.
“The internet of things”, we are told, is coming. Everything, everywhere, is going to be online. I presume that also means our cars. We are also told that racing is where the innovation is happening, that what’s being developed for the race track now will trickle down to our cars in a few years’ time. I can’t wait for my car to have 3D printed titanium wheel hubs, and WebSockets. Last year I participated in what is probably Norway’s toughest student project, Revolve NTNU. As a team of 46 devoted students, we were building Norway’s first electric race car. Competing with top students from 114 other schools and universities from all over the world, the competitions took place in both Germany and the UK. If we wanted to compete against the best, we needed not only to build a really, really good car, but we needed to train our drivers and set up the car properly. This is the story of how we used WebSockets to democratize our live telemetry data.

The case for running an own datacenter is vanishing rapidly. The cloud seduces with a low barrier of entry and full flexibility. Infrastructure can be spun up almost instantly in a fully automated way through an API. All this with no upfront costs and the ability to decommission it just as fast. But what does this mean for our applications and their architecture? Can we just lift and shift them to the cloud? Everything comes at a price. To be able to fully leverage the potential of the cloud, new challenges must be mastered: from data privacy and security to cost-based architectures, dynamic provisioning, service discovery and efficient deployment models. This talk provides architects and developers clear answers and battle-tested solutions for a successful journey to infrastructure heaven.
