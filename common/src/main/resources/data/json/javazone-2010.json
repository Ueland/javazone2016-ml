Buildr combines the expressiveness of the Ruby scripting language with a familiar dependency-based task execution model and project-level structure similar to Apache Maven. This session will introduce Buildr and demonstrate practical solutions to common build problems. Examples will be taken from actual build systems including large-scale Apache projects and frequently-asked questions from the mailing list. In particular, we will demonstrate integration with Apache Ant tasks, handling of multi-lingual projects, and customizations for various source-generation and packaging requirements.",

In modern computers memory is a complex multi-layered thing affected by the hardware, operating system and the JVM. And considering that it's shared among multiple CPUs we get a lot of classical distributed problems without an actual network anywhere in sight.",

To answer those questions I'll build a simple CPU model in Java to illustrate the concepts in a comprehensible way.",

This talk introduces the audience to some of the more likely scenarios where mobile and Cloud Computing will be seen working together and augmenting each others strengths.",
    "description": "h1. How the Cloud is and will be an invisible presence in many mobile applications. As two technologies that are increasing rapidly in importance and spread both PaaS/SaaS and mobile devices (“phones”) are highly important technologies on their own. Closer to 750 million people are now using cellphones world wide. And PaaS is in the beginning of every hype curve. Together these two technologies pose an emerging opportunity and solution to many existing and likely business cases. The needs that drive these business cases are on one hand the need for a mobile application with an optimal usage of the mobile device when it comes to screen size, GUI lock and feel, processing and bandwidth. And on the other side the need for at least one or more of the following: * High processing capabilities, high volumes of data and high bandwidth. * Collaboration, Data sharing, Multitasking and Scheduling The type off distributed application that emerges from these needs and wants are applications where the client is a cellphone with a thin or semi-thick client software with a backend running on a PaaS solution. The high and growing number of cellphones with increasing capabilities means that the potential market is far larger than for a personal computer software solution. There are a number of reasons why the PaaS approach is preferable and possibly the only solution compared to a thick client software solution on the cellphone. These can be the limited storage space, processing power and bandwidth. Also the need realtime and data with a short shelf life dictates a solution where the data is aggregated and stored centrally. Sharing data and collaboration are others. The client ideally uses the native lock and feel of the client platform. The bandwidth needed between the cellphone client and PaaS side should be optimized by using lean protocols and possible compression of data. The PasS side should be able to scale dynamically based on changing client numbers.",

I utviklingen av nytt system for vurdering av søknader om forskningsmidler for Norges Forskningsråd dukket dette behovet opp. Med dagens teknologi er det ikke lengre behov for å bruke tradisjonelle offline-formater og produkter som PDF, Word og Excel for å tilby funksjonalitet også når man er offline. Google Gears brøytet veien for offline web mens nye standarder i HTML 5 asfalterer veien videre. I dette foredraget går vi gjennom hvordan vi har løst utfordringen med offline tilgang ved å bruke Google Gears og veien videre med HTML 5. Vi vil vise hvordan arkitekturen settes opp, hvordan man tilgjengeliggjør websider og data offline, hvordan man sender disse tilbake til server og sørger for konsistens. Alt med kodeeksempler og live demo.",

To make matters worse, some of the test configurations requires specific hardware options. To solve this, we've developed an extension to TestNG where each test specifies what resources it requires to run. In this session we describe how we've implemented a resource pool which allocates test resources as specified by the tests. Each test can specify a number of systems based on properties like system type, hardware options or software version, and those systems will not be allocated to any other for as long as the test is running. Before the systems are entered into the pool they can be automatically configured, and they are reset between between test runs to ensure that the ordering of tests doesn't influence the result. The resource pool itself are written to be as general as possible, so that it should be easy to change storage backends or even to use it for projects outside of TANDBERG's development department.",

Web verdenen er et godt eksempel på et område hvor dette kanskje er spesielt aktuelt. Det er nå flere Java web-rammeverk enn vi kan telle, og nye dukker fortsatt opp med jevne mellomrom. Tanken på å lage sitt eget web-rammeverk virker nok rimelig søkt for de aller fleste. Dette hindret derimot ikke oss... to ganger. I de to siste prosjektene vi har vært med på er det nettopp dette vi gjorde. Dette skjedde litt på grunn av tilfeldighetenes spill, litt fordi vi rett og slett hadde lyst, men mest fordi vi syntes de tilgjengelige rammeverkene var for dårlige. Vi tenkte, som så mange før oss, at det burde være mulig å gjøre dette bedre selv. Med et fundament basert på rammeverk som Spring, Jersey og jQuery satt vi oss fore å lage et rammeverk som kunne gi oss raskest mulig time to market, samtidig som det skulle være vedlikeholdbart over tid. På tross av etablerte sannheter og \"sunn fornuft\", mener vi dette var et riktig valg. I dette foredraget ønsker jeg oppsumere erfaringene fra disse to prosjektene. Hva ble konsekvensene av valgene våre? Hva fungerte? Hva tok vi med videre i prosjekt nr. 2. Hva var det som ikke fungerte? Er vi fortsatt like fornøyd nå over 1 1/2 år etter produksjonsstart av prosjekt 1? Og ikke minst - hva skal vi ta med til neste prosjekt?

The industry is reacting with hardware with an ever-growing number of cores and software that can leverage \"grids\" of distributed, often commodity, computing resources. But how is a traditional Java developer supposed to easily take advantage of this revolution? The answer is the Apache Hadoop family of projects. Hadoop is a suite of Open Source APIs at the forefront of this grid computing revolution and is considered the absolute gold standard for the divide-and-conquer model of distributed problem crunching. The well-travelled Apache Hadoop framework is curently being leveraged in production by prominent names such as Yahoo, IBM, Amazon, Adobe, AOL, Facebook and Hulu just to name a few. In this session, you'll start by learning the vocabulary unique to the distributed computing space. Next, we'll discover how to shape a problem and processing to fit the Hadoop MapReduce framework. We'll then examine the incredible auto-replicating, redundant and self-healing HDFS filesystem. Finally, we'll fire up several Hadoop nodes and watch our calculation process get devoured live by our Hadoop cluster. At this talk's conclusion, you'll understand the suite of Hadoop tools and where each one fits in the aim of conquering large data sets.",

Starting from high-level tests helps us focus on what to deliver and to produce with better structural designs. Early integration also helps to flush out project issues at the start--when we have time to do something about it.",
    "description": "We present our experience applying \"system-test first\" test-driven development (TDD) in the development of large systems and systems-of-systems. We try to address integration and system testing as early as possible. The sooner the system is in a deployable state, the easier it is to react to changing business needs because we can deliver new features to users as soon as is deemed necessary. We therefore start by writing tests that build and deploy the system and interact with it from the outside and, to make those tests pass, add code to the system in the classic \"unit-test first\" TDD style. Many teams applying TDD start writing unit-tests and leave integration and system testing until late in the project because they find it difficult to write tests that cope with the distributed architecture and concurrent behaviour of their system. We will describe how we address common pitfalls, including unreliable tests, tests that give false positives, slow-running tests and test code that becomes difficult to maintain as the system grows. We will also describe how writing system tests guides our architectural decisions. Writing unit tests first guides design of the code to be flexibile and maintainable. In a similar way, we have found that writing system tests first guides the architecture to be easier to monitor, manage and support.",

This nightmare scenario is a realistic risk for most multi-user systems as they are written and deployed today. What has happened is that the shift from \"faster processors\" to \"more cores\" changes the characteristics of performance (latency and response time vs capacity and throughput). What we risk is that our software architecture will not be able to take advantage of hardware upgrades. Thus the shift to multicore will push us out of the \"call stack comfort zone\" and force us to rethink how we model and architect our systems.

Sisu is the IoC system Sonatype has built on top of Guice, and is the base platform upon which all our tools are now built, including Maven 3.0. Aether is the new Repository API that has been generalized and decoupled from Maven which can be used as a stand-alone library to give any Java application some Maven repository-fu. Maven Shell what we see becoming the de facto way to use Maven 3.0. A long lived process with Maven super powers. Polyglot Maven is evolving into a family of DSLs to provide novel ways to use the Maven 3.0 core. Proviso is the production runtime provisioning system Sonatype is using internally for continuous delivery and is based on the powerful Eclipse p2 provisioning platform. Benson is Sonatype's Maven-focused distribution of Hudson taking into account everything that we've learned about Maven 3.0 during its development and how Maven should operate optimally within a CI environment: there will be no better way to work with Maven and Hudson. Benson is Hudson's brother from another mother. If there is time maybe we'll talk a little bit about Maven 3.1.",

Developers and businesses alike are all trying to catch and align themselves with this new standard. Out of all the ideas and features in this new set of specifications, the most intriguing, exciting, and controversial section is HTML5 WebSocket. At first glance, some misinterpret WebSocket as merely a better transport protocol and replacement of HTTP or XHR. However, upon additional understanding, one quickly learns WebSocket is NOT a replacement or improved version of HTTP or XHR, nor do we want it to be! HTML5 WebSocket is a standard with the potential to bring unprecedented change to an otherwise very stale Web. What makes this new communication fabric so important is its simplicity and extensibility. We all assumed the Web was just there, and that HTTP provided everything we needed for Web communication. HTML5 WebSocket is the evolution of the communication fabric TO, ACROSS and WITHIN the Web and Cloud, and now we need to open our minds and start looking at the possibilities of this new way to communicate over the Web! Take this communication channel and combine it with some of the other new features coming with HTML5 such as Canvas and off-line storage and it is time to start thinking BIG, really BIG! This session is targeted developers and architects that are looking for better ways of increasing user experience and communication over the Web to create, improve, or replace existing Web applications. The session is also targeted developers and architects that just want to stretch their minds and receive the necessary information on making an educated assessment of the business and technical opportunities, and challenges, made possible by this new HTML5 standard. Wickedly cool demos, code examples, and comparisons with existing technologies and architectures will be used to illustrate these possibilities and their use cases.",

Det meste av det som blir presentert har sin bakgrunn i enterprise integration patterns. All implementasjonskode vil tilgjengeliggjøres. En viktig forutsetning for disse teknikkene og ideene er at ytelse ofte er ofret til fordel for enkelhet og robusthet, fordi kravene til batchsystemer ofte ikke er like harde på tid. Når det er sagt så har vi også kjørt nokså store transaksjonsvolum gjennom lignende arkitektur og den har vist seg å ha både tilfredstillende ytelse og tilfredstillende skalerbarhet.

The other arts show a similar pattern: every individual artwork participates in an artistic form of some kind, which provides beneficial boundaries around the kind of expression that form can carry. This provides a useful metaphor for software development. Rather than comparing languages and platforms using benchmarks and feature lists, the savvy architect pays attention to the tool's form. What is the tool naturally good at? What kind of values and priorities are reflected in a technology choice? Are they consistent with values of the team or the organization?

Men, REST egner seg ikke i alle situasjoner og utviklere får problemer når tjenestene skal implementere mer avanserte løsninger. Da må man ofte ty til løsninger som er tungvinte eller som bryter med prinsippene bak REST. Denne lyntalen diskuterer restriksjonene rundt REST og viser eksempler på hvordan man kan få problemer hvis man velger REST. Vit hva du gjør, kjenn restriksjonene rundt REST og ikke vær religiøs/fanatisk tilhenger!",

However, fewer developers are familiar with Spring's support for enterprise integration. In this session, Mark will provide a comprehensive overview of Spring's support for messaging, scheduling, and batch processing. You will learn how these features provide a platform for event-driven architecture. Examples will include integration with JMS, Web Services, email, and more. You will also learn about Spring's support for Hohpe and Woolf's Enterprise Integration Patterns including demos of Transformation, Routing, Splitting, and Aggregation of messages. Finally, you will see how the Spring Batch and Spring Integration projects may be used together for automation of batch operations.",

    "description": "Gartner har mobile applikasjoner på sin topp 10-liste over strategiske teknologier for 2010. Apple har med sin iPhone til nå vært nærmest enerådende i dette markedet, men har nå fått skarp konkurranse av Googles mobile operativsystem Android. Det selges mer enn 60.000 Android-enhter daglig, og Gartner spår at Android blir større enn iPhone i løpet av de neste to årene. Ikke bare er Android basert på Java, men utvilking er enkelt og ikke minst gratis å komme igang med. Dette foredraget vil fortelle deg hvordan. Android 101 gir en introduksjon til utvikling på Android. Etter en gjennomgang av Androids forhistorie, går vi gjennom de mest sentrale konseptene i Android SDK. Disse konseptene danner basis for å forstå hvordan man utvikler applikasjoner enkelt og effektivt. Vi avslutter foredraget med å gå gjennom et praktisk eksempel på utvikling av en applikasjon som nyttiggjør seg flere av disse konseptene. Vi viser hvordan applikasjonen kan debugges, før vi går gjennom hvordan applikasjonssigneringsprosessen fungerer. Etter å ha demonstrert dette, slipper vi den på Android Market!",

    "summary": "Cloud computing is changing the fundamental assumption of how business applications are built and run. Scala has successfully merged statically and strongly typed object-oriented concepts with functional programming paradigm. Both of them combined define a bleeding edge for new wave of Java-based business application development. These new trends will define business application development for years to come and that’s why developers need to be aware of them today.",
    "description": "The topic of this presentation is about using Scala programming language with GridGain’s cloud development platform to provide a simple and productive cloud computing platform. Scala is a hybrid function and object-oriented language that is rapidly gaining traction in becoming the “next” Java in JVM-based language evolution. GridGain is one of the most rapidly growing cloud development platforms for JVM-based languages. 2/3 of the presentation will be devoted to live coding demonstration of writing basic MapReduce application in Scala using GridGain middleware. All coding during demonstration will be done live. Overview of grid and cloud computing concepts as well as notion of Native Cloud Applications will be discussed. Short intro into Scala language will also be provided.",

    "description": "Most people tend to model systems using services and entities. They forget that entities exist over time, and transition from one state to another. Often, these states are modeled as status flags on the entity. Unfortunately, this doesn't really work out in practice. It's like trying to describe a complicated customer fulfillment process using a UML sequence diagram - it's missing a few things: who is doing what, and - most importantly - when. There is a better way: a workflow engine can be used to extricate the process state from your application, and manage it. In this talk, we will explore the basics of workflow engines, and of process oriented architectures. We will introduce Activiti - a powerful, lightweight, embeddable workflow engine created by Tom Baeyans (the creator of jBPM) from Alfresco and explore its use in a Spring-based application",

    "description": "Over the last few years, I have been meeting \"Erlang people\" more and more often, and I am getting the impression that they have a magical ability to reason intuitively about concurrent systems in a way that I have not. It corresponds somewhat to the way we \"object heads\" think intuitively about classes and objects - just in terms of processes. That bothered me, so I wanted to learn Erlang. Being a language implementor, the most obvious way to do that is to just go ahead and implement an Erlang VM, right? The result of this \"little exercise\" is Erjang, an open-source JVM-based Erlang VM. It has turned into a non-trivial project, Erjang is now 50k lines of Java code, it runs substantial erlang programs, including booting OTP so you can use the Eshell, it self-hosts the erlang compiler (erlc) and tcp/ip functionality works. In this talk, I would like to take you through some of the issues, problems and solutions that I saw going through that exercise. And specifically, I will take you through what I think is wrong with \"Java concurrency\", and in which situations the conceptual model in Erlang is better.

    "summary": "Writing concurrent software is complex, and there are many pitfalls and hazards to watch out for. However it is a lot easier to write threadsafe classes up front than to add concurrency later. What then should you do if you need to add concurrency to your existing system?",
    "description": "Vårt problem: fakturavolumet hadde vokst over hodet på vår Java batchapplikasjon. Etter iherdige forsøk for å øke ytelsen på vår serielle applikasjon, så parallellprosessering ut til å være eneste løsning. Vår første utfordring var å finne hvordan vi skulle parallellprosessere. Skulle vi bruke flere instanser av applikasjonen eller tråder? Valget falt på å bruke tråder, men hvor skulle vi benytte tråder, og var koden vi skulle parallellisere trådsikker? Kodebasen hadde vært utviklet over flere år, og ingen hadde dessverre fokusert nevneverdig på trådsikkehet. Neste steg på veien var derfor å analysere og dokumentere klassenes trådsikkerhet. Selve kodearbeidet gikk ut på å fjerne delt tilstand der det var mulig, og å dele opp og fyre i gang deloppgaver. Vår største utfordring var med en modul som måtte ha delt tilstand, og vi kommer til å presentere alle løsningene vi trodde ville virke, og den som til slutt fungerte. Implementasjonen vår brukte deler av Java 5 concurrency-APIet og vi kommer også til å demonstrere vår bruk og verifisering av denne koden. Vi hadde utviklet, verifisert, og ytelsestestet og valgte å produksjonssette. Dessverre oppstod mystiske feil i produksjon, og mistanken gikk straks til den nyinnførte trådingen. Vi fikk derfor også kost oss med den tidkrevende oppgaven med feilsøking av trådfeil. Gjennom presentasjonen ønsker vi å presentere steg for steg hvordan vi gikk fram, hvilke feil vi gjorde, og bakgrunn for de valgene vi tok. Vi vil også presentere noen generelle utfordringer innenfor parallellprosessering, inkludert implementasjon, testing, feilsøking, APIer og profilingverktøy.",

    "description": "The usual format for a code dojo is fairly well known: participants split into small groups, each group codes on their own laptop, all groups work on the same coding exercise with keyboard drivers rotating within the each group periodically. Towards the end of the dojo the coding stops and everyone presents their work in turn. This form of practice is often called a kata. A cyber-dojo is different in one important respect: each group still has their own laptop but they all perform the kata completely inside a web browser. A dedicated cyber-dojo server hosts the kata, saving the source files (and the outcome of running the tests) every time the run-the-tests button is pressed in the browser. Running a code-dojo in this manner creates many new exciting benefits including: 1. starting the kata is virtually instant - participants do not need anything installed at all. 2. all the step-by-step incremental run-tests submissions can be inspected helping to place a much greater emphasis on the decisions taken during the kata rather than simply the code at the end of the kata. 3. the cyber-dojo server allows everyone to peek at the current submissions of all groups! 4. since all development environments are now identical it is even possible to introduce timeboxed iterations to the kata and rotate codebases amongst the groups at each iteration! 5. it speeds up the end of kata retrospective (since you don't have to physically involve each individual laptop).",

In this session, you will get a brief introduction to NoSQL and learn why you should consider retiring your trusty relational database in your next project. There are still things that relational databases do better than NoSQL, but you will see that in most cases the downside for scaling is not worth it. Important NoSQL systems to be aware of and that will be covered in this overview are cassandra, hbase/hadoop, CouchDB, MongoDB and Tokyo Cabinet. You will see specific examples of how the schemaless nature of CouchDB allows you to store multiple types of documents in a single database and why this is a good thing. Learn how CouchDB's powerful map reduce views can rid your code of SQL or SQL abstractions. A database without replication is useless and master-slave replication still makes for a slightly rigid and vulnerable storage system. Learn about CouchDB's master-master replication and how it's filters enables partial replications. Replication is both data protection and scaling to handle more load. To handle more data, you need to shard your data. Sharding is dividing your data across different servers. While you can preshard your data, the scary bit is often to reshard a running system. See how Pillow can help you handle your sharding and resharding needs. Reliability and consistency are important for a large scale storage system. You learn why eventual consistency is sufficient and how to ensure your system is reliable. There is also a reason why CouchDB and Pillow are both written in Erlang and you will get some background for these choices.

    "description": "Software estimation is an inherently difficult discipline. Research has found indications that increasingly popular agile frameworks may in fact reduce overruns, yet agile organizations are hardly immune to overruns, delays and bad business decisions based on poor estimates. A practice such as planning poker may be beneficial. However, it only deals with some aspects related to the complex process of software estimation. The agile literature is mainly concerned with estimating sprints or releases, and does not address underlying issues such as estimates of overall project schedule and cost. There are also many other estimation pitfalls related to organizational issues in desperate need of attention. This talks presents seven cost-efficient ways to reduce your project overruns, ranging from simple checklists, to target-price contracts. It is suitable for customers, contractors, managers, team-members and anybody else frustrated with unpaid overtime, cancelled vacations and stranded projects.",

Det er på tide at vi slutter å forsøke å kjøpe oss ut av problemet med dyre, kompliserte løsninger og benytter intelligensen vår i stedet. \"There is no silver bullet\" skrev Fred Brooks i et paper i 1986 og siktet til at det ikke finnes noen teknologi som dramatisk vil forbedre effektivitet innenfor et tiår. Det virker som vi ofte vil tro på denne sølvkulen. Integrasjon er vanskelig. Og det hjelper ikke at vi forsøker å unngå problemet med produkter. Disse produktene kan gjøre ting litt enklere, men de gir også ekstra infrastruktur, bugs, ukjent software og lite transparens. Ved å holde seg til enkle prinsipper og rammeverk kommer man faktisk lenger på kort tid. I dette foredraget vil jeg ta for meg noen glemte fakta om integrasjon, og vise hvordan man kan bruke abstraksjon og enkle rammeverk for å gjøre integrasjon på en god måte. Kanskje du skulle bruke RMI? Hessian? Eller litt REST? Litt WS-* kanskje? Alle er forskjellige, det viktige er å finne ut hvordan du kan utnytte de best. Vær pragmatisk og jeg lover deg at du får en mye hyggeligere hverdag. Dette handler i bunn og grunn om enkle prinsipper og kontroll, men vi har alt for lenge forsøkt å unngå å lære oss disse tingene.

This session introduces JTA, how a cache fits the picture and how to take advantages of the benefits Ehcache JTA brings to application developers.",
    "description": "With systems growing larger, architects keep on looking for faster, yet also as consistent as possible storage solutions. Caching the data close to its consumers is a well known approach, that comes with its challenges. But also at the cost of loosing much of what the database provides: a transactional and consistent data storage. This session will show, with concrete code examples, how a JTA enabled cache addresses issues faced by system implementors and architects: * How does a transactional cache compares to a non-transactional one ? * What does XA provide you with for consistency ? * How does a JTA cache fit in an existing Java application ? * How does it fit in an XA environment ? * How was it implemented ?",

Hvordan får man til en smidig overgang fra sitt trauste sentraliserte versjonskontrollsystem? Er verktøyene modne nok? Kreves det superutviklere eller kan alle ta det i bruk? Hva slags arbeidsflyt og prosesser skal man bruke? Vi har tatt i bruk Git i et større Java-prosjekt som omfatter forvaltning og videreutvikling av et salgssystem. Systemet har vært i drift siden 2002. Inntil i fjor benyttet vi ClearCase som versjonskontrollsystem, men valgte å gå over til Git. Motivasjonen var å få bedre ytelse, flere muligheter samt å spare penger. I dette foredraget ønsker jeg å dele våre erfaringer med Git. Jeg vil dekke både selve migreringen fra et versjonskontrollsystem til et annet, utfordringer vi har støtt på og \"best practice\" for daglig bruk av Git i prosjektet vårt.

Testene blir langt mer robust for endringer og mye tydligere i forhold til å forstå kravet. JRebel er et verktøy som gjør at man kan endre javakode på en kjørende server uten hotdeploy eller andre teknikker. Når man lagrer en kodeendring i IDEet oppdateres denne automatisk i kjørende Jetty serveren uten deploy. Dette er både enklere og langt raskere enn tradisjonell hotdeploy funksjonalitet som man f.eks. finner i Tomcat.

    "description": "Most languages allow source code to be organized in smaller units, like e.g. packages in Java. Usually, these units can be organized in their turn, thus creating a hierarchy of packages and classes, interfaces, enumerations, etc... In Java, these packages are closely tied to the file system's directory structure, which may not always be an advantage. Hierarchical structures are typical of the 20th century. In the 21st century, however, tagging has become a much more popular way to classify objects. Web sites like Delicious and Flickr are examples of places where people tag objects using keywords rather than storing them in a hierarchy. Just compare those sites to the yellow pages of the early days of the Internet, and you can see the difference in flexibility. So why do we stick to strict hierarchies for our source code while we're boasting we're so agile in everything else? Tagging the code with multiple tags allows programmers to browse the source code of a project using different perspectives. Do you want to browse your code by layer or by feature? Maybe you're trying to find all classes using a certain pattern? Maybe code coverage doesn't matter that much in a particular layer of your application, but is critical in one of the subdomains of the model? Clearly, a more flexible way to look at your code than a simple hierarchy would be more than welcome!",

Do you think that some aspects of your web application cannot be tested automatically? Let us prove you wrong! Starting from scratch, we pair program a Java web application which accesses the database, using only the servlet-API for the web part. Every aspect of the application is written test first. The whole development takes less than one hour from start to finish. Through the course of developing the application, we will introduce several useful libraries which makes it easy to write good tests for different aspects of a web/database application.",

Johannes has been practicing test-driven development for ten years. He finds the practice hard, especially with new designs and patterns. As a result, whenever he runs across a problem that's difficult to test, he works on it repeatedly until he finds a good way to test it - a kata."

Dette fører til at applikasjoner blir planlagt på designavgjørelser som har utelatt å ta opp et essensielt spørsmål; vil denne applikasjonen tjene på å bli skrevet i et språk som fokuserer på skjønnhet i kildekode? I denne lyntalen beskriver jeg begrepet om estetikk ved å bevege presentasjonen gradvis fra den tradisjonelle betydningen over til hvordan estetikk også er like aktuelt og synlig i språk. I lys av dette viser jeg at kildekode også er påvirket som en direkte konsekvens. Målet med lyntalen er å vise at skjønnhet absolutt er tilstede i språk og kan være med på å heve kvaliteten på programvare. Samtidig ønsker jeg å inspirere utviklere til å strebe etter en estetisk perfekt uttrykkelse i kode ved å vise hvilke fordeler det gir.",

Snodig nok og heldigvis lar disse teknologiene seg utmerket vel kombinere. I dette foredraget vil jeg gå igjennom hvordan du kan gjør nettopp det. Vi vil se på hvilke verktøy du vil benytte og kommer til å gå litt utenfor de stiene Google har gått opp for oss. Av dette får vi endel fordeler, men noen kameler må også svelges underveis. Som eksempel vil vi bruke et JMX systemovervåkingsverktøy (LittleBro) skrevet i nettopp Scala på Android. Formålet med dette foredraget er å gi tilhørerne lyst og kunnskap til selv å skrive Android-applikasjoner i Scala.",
