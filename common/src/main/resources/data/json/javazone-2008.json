Noen ganger har man behov for å splitte opp større jobber for eksempel for å utnytte datakraften som er tilgjengelig over flere prosessorkjerner, prosessorer og servere. Teknikker, infrastruktur og rammeverk finnes for dette, men de er ofte komplekse å sette opp, vanskelig å forstå og påvirker designet i for stor grad. Jeg ønsker å gi en enkel (teknologi og produktuavhengig) introduksjon til parallellisering, hvilke forutsetninger som må være på plass for at oppgaver gjøres i parallell, noen problemstillinger knyttet til å parallellisere, teknikkene master - worker, og map og reduce, og eksempler på en del typiske problemer som er egnet for parallellisering. Dersom du allerede jobber med storskala parallellisering er nok ikke dette presentasjonen for deg, dette er heller ikke en presentasjon av googles MapReduce rammeverk. Etter en introduksjonen til parallellisering vil jeg beskrive noen konkrete problemstillinger fra BBS hvor vi har hatt behov for å parallellisere jobber. Jeg kommer til å forklare hvorfor vi trengte å splitte opp og parallelisere jobbene, hvordan vi gjorde det, samt hva vi oppnådde rent konkret ytelsesmessig.",

    "level": "advanced",
    "summary": "Did you ever want to be the Big Brother of the Java Virtual Machine? Being able to do non intrusive monitoring of method calls without access to the source code, performing this in a production environment without a noticeable performance hit? Do you want to know who is doing what to whom, that is, who invokes what method in context of which principal? Making certain that memory consumption is dynamically adjusted to avoid out of memory situations? Would you also like to use it in your legacy applications running pre Java 5 as well as utilize the new Java agent interface of the newer JVMs? You know you have to collect vast amount of data and process it effectively and in real time. Finally you figure out that the amount of data exceeds the capabilities of a traditional data model and you decide that the only solution is a dimensional data model, using MDX for multi dimensional analysis. There are numerous tools available for profiling and measuring your Java programs. However these tools are either: a) aimed at profiling or measuring your code in a development environment; b) expensive; c) not open source; d) requires a Ph.D. in debugging and profiling e) any combination of the above :-) Usemon (usemon.org) attempts to alleviate this by providing an open source tool which is easy to use, collects data from environments based upon Java 1.4 through 6, has a flexible dimensional data model stored in a SQL database and attempts to be non-intrusive. Usemon hooks into the Java virtual machine through a modified class loader on older JVMs or via the Java Agent Interface from version 5 and up. It automatically monitors Java EE components (EJBs, Servlets, MDBs, Queues, SQL Statements, etc), but can be configured to inspect any class in your JVM. Data is multicasted from agents to one or more collectors and stored in the DBMS of your choice. Usemon comes with a complete configuration for MySQL. The overhead of running Usemon is negligible and thus you may collect run-time statistics around the clock all year, which is rather fascinating, given that you have enough disk space. Usemon was developed for large Java EE environments at Telenor, which is one of the worlds largest telco to fulfill these requirements. You may utilize it in any environment in which you have control over the Java Virtual Machine start up parameters. For example Java EE applications, Spring based Web applications or simply your own home grown web application packaged in a .war file.",

That's right! The event-driven Web does not necessitate a \"click\" to deliver content. With this new paradigm, developers can initiate messages and events on the server—messages that are delivered to any type of Web client, including clients such as the iPhone, without the need for browser plug-ins or traditional polling. End-users receive streams of data, in real-time, making it possible to deliver data to clients as it arrives without the need to wait on a pool interval. Low latency delivery of information makes the Web an accommodating place for applications once thought to only be possible on the desktop, e.g., financial trading, auctions, sports betting, tools for analytics, business activity monitoring. To understand the concept of event-driven Web, you first must understand its origins, the technologies and requirements behind it, its place in your applications, and the pitfalls. In this session, we will introduce you to all of the above with special focus on the pitfalls related to reversing the Web with an event-driven paradigm. Considerations that we will discuss include connection limitations, network flooding, and scalability. In addition, attendees will be introduced to the various architectural options that are available to address these concerns.

The first paradox of lean development is that by doing one thing at a time instead of trying to do many things simultaneously, everything will get done faster. The second paradox of lean development is that if you never fail, you never learn, and learning is the essence of product development.

I have struggeled with this problem since my first encounter with the Spring framework, and over the years I have tried just about all the techniques there are. Some of them turned out to be bad - some of them turned out to be really bad. In this talk I will go through some of the techniques and approaches I have tried, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Based on these trials and errors, I have put together a framework that aims to enhance the Spring container - enabling it to be differently configured for different target systems.

Nettopp derfor er det så viktig at kunnskapen formidles på en slik måte at alle har de beste mulige forutsetninger for å lykkes med å lære. Ulike roller og bakgrunn er med på å skape et komplekst bilde med lærende og lærere. Gjennom foredraget trekkes det paralleller mellom kunnskapsformidling internt i bedrifter, eksternt til kunder og til Bachelor studenter. Det pekes på utfordringer og muligheter knyttet til kunnskapsformidling og hva slags lærdom man kan ta med seg fra de ulike vinklingene. Man går også i dybden på den forskningsbaserte undervisningen som er et påkrevd fundament for alle høgskoler i Norge i dag og ser hvordan forskningsbasert opplæring kan være med på å gi kunnskapsøkning i bedrifter en ny dimensjon. Praktiske teknikker presenteres for å gi tilhørerne et konkret ”produkt” å ta med seg tilbake til egen hverdag. Gjennom presentasjonen settes det fokus på teknikker som forskningsbasert undervisning og hva det vil si både å gjennomføre dette, men også hva man får ut av det. I tillegg vies det blant annet tid til å se på prosjektbasert læring og prinsipper rundt scaffolding (stillasbygging).

    "level": "intermediate",
    "summary": "Domain-Specific Languages are an \"architectural hot-spot\", as coined recently by InfoQ editors. With dynamic languages such as Groovy, it is easy to create a mini-language modelling a particular business domain. Thanks to these DSLs, developers and subject matter experts will be able to share a common metaphor, to deliver, hand in hand, the final application to the end users.",
    "description": "Groovy offers a great deal of flexibility in terms of concise and expressive syntax, and through its dynamic nature. After an introduction to the Groovy dynamic language, and to the concepts of DSLs, their motivation, strenghts and weaknesses, Guillaume Laforge, project lead of Groovy and spec lead of JSR-241 standardizing the Groovy language, will guide you through the advanced Groovy concepts that will help you create your own embedded DSL. He will show you how to integrate them in your JEE application, and also explain how to best design such business languages to ensure their adoption by the end users, their quality, testability, andcapacity to evolve over time to suit the needs of the day. In the IT industry, understanding the domain within which customers evolve is a key factor in the success of a project. From this domain and its wealth of concepts, as software developers and architects, we can derive a design that is aimed at solving problems encountered in the day-to-day business. So far, we mostly solved these brainteasers with computer science paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming, n-tier architectures, or with tools such as rules engines to stay close to the domain at hand. In this session, our goal will be to investigate how the paradigm of Domain-Specific Languages can be leveraged to help our teams build solutions closer to our users' needs and requirements, and how it can provide a viable, efficient and expressive alternative problem-solving pattern. The technology of choice for enabling DSL solutions for your projects will be Groovy, a dynamic language for the Java platform.",

    "level": "intermediate",
    "summary": "This talk focuses on the ways that Groovy can turn a traditional Java developer's world-view upside down.",
    "description": "Summary We'll start by talking about how you can thumb your nose at The Man by leaving out many of the main syntactic hallmarks of Java: semicolons, parentheses, return statements, type declarations (aka duck-typing), even try/catch blocks. Of course, there's no way that we'd leave metaprogramming out of the discussion... What is metaprogramming? We'll add new methods to classes at runtime -- even if they were originally implemented in Java; even if they were declared final. (Thanks, ExpandoMetaClass!) We'll call methods that don't exist and avoid the dreaded MethodNotFound Exception. (Thanks, invokeMethod!) We'll narrowly scope our metaprogramming shenanigans using Use blocks and Categories, and then cast our changes to the wind such that every instance of a class gets our added juice. If you are happy taking the Blue Pill, this talk is not for you. You can continue using Groovy as a slimmed-down dialect of Java -- an \"After\" picture to Java's \"Before\". If, however, the Red Pill looks interesting, please join me. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more. Expected audience: This session is aimed squarely at Java developers. The more experience you have, the better, but even neophytes will appreciate what Groovy offers Java developers. Experience with other dynamic languages like Ruby, JavaScript, or Python will help, but certainly isn't required. Required experience: You should be comfortable with the basic syntactic rules of Java (so that we can mercilessly squash them). You should understand the basic \"Laws of Java\" when it comes to the semantics of a statically typed language (so that we can kick sand in its face). Most importantly, you should posses an open mind and a belly full of Dynamic-language KoolAid. This is not the forum for someone to vocally defend the merits of checked exceptions and static typing. You will be unceremoniously tossed out on your ear, Jerry Springer-style. Seriously. I'm not trying to convince you that this is the way you should write Java. The status quo can defend itself quite nicely, thank you very much. I'm here to show you how your code could look, if you so desire.",

    "level": "intermediate",
    "summary": "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides a fantastic way to deploy scalable machine images, but what to do when you want an application to scale across the machine images you have provisioned? This session discusses the Elastic Grid, an approach that provides dynamic allocation, management, and scalability of applications, using Amazon EC2 as the backbone. It also introduces the open-source technologies Elastic Grid is based on: Rio and Apache River (Jini™ network technology). The Elastic Grid provides an architecture for developing, deploying, and managing distributed applications composed of services. Key to the architecture are a set of dynamic capabilities and reliance on policy-based and quality-of-service mechanisms. The Elastic Grid reduces the complexity surrounding the development of dynamic services by introducing Jini network technology remoting for POJOs as well as by providing a simple component model. The Elastic Grid extends Amazon EC2's virtual grid environment, enabling users to manage and dynamically scale Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) based on declarable SLAs, as well as deal with partial failure of AMI instances. Rio reduces the complexity surrounding the development of dynamic services by introducing dynamic Jini network technology remoting for POJOs, as well as providing a simple component model. The presentation demonstrates how IntelliJ plug-ins for Amazon EC2 and Rio ease building and deploying a sample application distributed over the Amazon EC2 grid. With the Elastic Grid solution, the application will scale on the Amazon EC2 grid by starting and stopping Amazon EC2 instances accordingly to declared SLAs (service-level agreements).",

Newspeak is a principled dynamic language, and incorporates lessons drawn from a decade of experience maintaining the Java language and VM specifications.",
    "description": "Newspeak takes the principle of programming to an interface to its logical conclusion: every operation in Newspeak is effectively a virtual method invocation. This includes references to fields, classes and superclasses. Classes my nest arbitrarily, as in Beta. Since all names are late bound, all classes are virtual; in particular, superclasses are virtual, so all classes act as mixins. There is no static state in Newspeak. Instead, top level classes act as module definitions, which are independent, immutable, self-contained parametric namespaces. They can be instantiated into modules which may be stateful and mutually recursive. Naturally, like its predecessors, Newspeak is reflective: a mirror library allows structured access to the program meta-level, including the ability to modify the code while it executes. Synergy between a small number of key design decisions makes for a language that is small, expressive, modular, and lays a foundation for security as well.",

We'll talk about calling Java classes from Groovy, and calling Groovy classes from Java. We'll look at Groovyc, the integrated compiler that manages Groovy/Java dependencies without a hiccup. There are wild-eyed radicals out there telling you that Java is dead, statically-typed languages are passe, and your skills are hopelessly out-of-date. Those extremists are the same ones who don't bat an eye at throwing out years of experience to learn a new language from scratch, pushing aside a familiar IDE for a new one, and deploying to a whole new set of production servers with little regard to legacy integration. While this \"burn the boats\" approach to software development might sound exciting to some folks, it's giving your manager the cold shakes right now. What if I told you that there was a way that you could integrate seamlessly with your legacy Java code, continue to use your trusty IDE and stable production servers, and yet take advantage of many of the exciting new dynamic language features that those fanatics keep prattling on about? You'd probably say, \"Groovy!\" I would, too... Not once will I tell you to throw out the old in favor of the new. In each case, I'll show you how to integrate the new with the old. Don't throw out your Ant build scripts; mix in a bit of Groovy to spice 'em up. Don't toss out your existing unit tests. (You are unit testing, aren't you? AREN'T YOU?) If not, Groovy is the perfect excuse to get started with a new language in way that improves the quality of your Java application without actually putting the new code into production. That is, until you get hooked on doing things the Groovy way... If the Red Pill of Dynamic Languages scares the pants off of you (or your manager), don't worry about it. The Blue Pill still offers plenty of benefits. There is no other language on the JVM that offers you the level of deep Java compatibility such that you could rename your \"dot J-A-V-A\" files to \"dot G-R-O-O-V-Y\" and not skip a beat. Of course, they both end up with a \"dot C-L-A-S-S\" extension at the end of the day, so there's good chance that no one would ever be the wiser anyway.

To make matters worse, complex technology and organizational processes inhibit our ability to act to new information with sufficient speed. The talk shows how we can implement a rigorous, yet agile process. It is based around our experiences of putting the good idea of continuous integration and other agile methods into life and using this as the basis not just for the technical process, but for the whole improvement program for our organization. We have expanded our process to cover simulated production as a part of the testing effort. This way, we can guarantee that the actual delivery day will be uneventful.

Dersom man har et høy ytelseskrav (100 eller 1.000 vis av transaksjoner pr. sekund) krever dette avansert og kostbar infrastruktur med mange servere og gjerne eget lagringsnett (SAN). Som Java utvikler gir dette en utfordring i forhold til hvordan man skal få utviklet og testet en slik applikasjon. Hvordan vet jeg at valgt arkitektur skalerer utover et par testservere? Hvordan vet jeg at løsningen skalerer i produksjonsmiljø over tid når volumene vokser? Dette foredraget gir et praktisk eksempel på hvordan man kan bruke Amazon EC2 som skalerbar infrastruktur for en Java Servlet basert applikasjon. Foredraget forutsetter ingen forkunnskap om EC2 og vil gi en kort introduksjon på hva EC2 er, hvordan det virker og hva man kan bruke det til.",

    "summary": "Apache Tapestry is an open source Java framework that combines the best features of two worlds: the heavy-duty performance and scalability of Java (not to mention its enterprise acceptance) with the productivity advantages of scripting languages such as Ruby. Java has emerged as the language for enterprise-class development: it has the widest adoption, the largest class libraries, the best performance, and greatest degree of enterprise acceptance ... and yet, traditional web development is a painful, unproductive slog: large amounts of configuration combined with constant recompiles and redeployments. Python and Ruby can be vastly more productive than Java but can't match Java in terms of performance and scalability, or acceptance in the enterprise. Tapestry bridges the gap between these two worlds. It embraces convention over configuration on many levels. It enhances productivity with live class reloading (changes to classes are picked up without a redeploy or restart) and best-of-breed exception reporting. Tapestry classes and templates are small, simple and immediately understandable. Tapestry applications are fast, efficient and highly scalable. Tapestry lets you work in terms of your objects and your methods: you can build entire applications and never think about a URL or a query parameter. Things just work! Tapestry is a component framework; we'll see how the built-in components provide broad functionality and yet are extremely extensible. Many of the components have built-in Ajax functionality, and building your own components is a snap. This session will feature live demonstrations and even a bit of live coding. We'll demonstrate how Tapestry keeps you happy and productive like a Ruby or Python coder but still delivers the results your boss and your customers need.",

Application development and deployment using SOA faces problems when organizational changes occur if the participating systems (service providers and consumers) are too tightly coupled. In SOA, messages and systems are inherently synchronous, promoting dependencies that filter to the organizational level. Resource Oriented Computing solves system and application integration issues by leveraging ESB, domain-specific languages, and shared memory mechanisms for integrating coupling points, not the applications themselves, by promoting event-driven interactions between system components, and by creating logical mappings of resources such as data or computations that are abstracted from the physical manifestation of the system deployment.",

Implementing such a dynamic and rich model, is not easy with an Object Oriented language like Java. The proposition of the authors, is that one can assist composing a song from audio fragments with the help of simple heuristics. Given that the audio is tagged with human recognisable information such as verse, refrain, lyrics, speed, starting and ending points.

    "level": "intermediate",
    "summary": "Mario Aparicio og Eirik R. Larsen fra Ciber presenterer erfaringer med bruk av webrammeverket Seam og prosessmotoren jBPM. VRVask er et system utviklet av CIBER Norge for validering, manuell korrigering, og rapportering av store antall banktransaksjoner. Systemet er todelt og består av en batch-applikasjon og en web-applikasjon som kommuniserer gjennom en felles database. For utvikling av web-applikasjonen ble webrammeverket Seam valgt. Bakgrunnen for dette valget er Seams abstraksjon av request / response modellen og støtte for lange brukerinteraksjoner, conversations. Batch-delen av løsningen ble utviklet som en standard Java-applikasjon med Spring og Hibernate. Vi opplevde Seam som et godt valg av rammeverk for web-løsningen da det gav enkel integrasjon mellom webgrensesnitt, domene og database. På enkelte områder støtte vi imidlertid på utfordringer som muligens kunne vært løst bedre med andre rammeverk. I utviklingen av batch-løsningen var Spring og Hibernate velegnede rammeverk for håndtering av database og dependency-injection. Derimot fikk vi problemer med håndtering av tilstandslogikk i batch-prosessen. Kompleksiteten ble undervurdert, og vi endte opp med å lagre tilstand i databasen og håndtere all tilstandslogikk programmatisk. Løsningen ble derfor vanskelig å utvikle og vedlikeholde. Etter å ha analysert problemene i batch-løsningen så vi at en prosessmotor med fordel kunne brukes for å håndtere tilstand. Vi valgte å se på prosessverktøyet jBPM da dette er et mye utprøvd verktøy som fungerer bra i et Java-miljø. jBPM er i tillegg godt integrert med andre JBoss-produkter som Hibernate og Seam. I presentasjonen beskriver vi positive og negative erfaringer med Seam i prosjektet og drøfter når det er fornuftig å bruke dette rammeverket fremfor andre web-rammeverk. Videre presenterer vi hvilke fordeler vi kan oppnå ved å bruke jBPM, og hvilke alternativer man har når man skal innføre et slikt verktøy i tilstandsfulle applikasjoner. Til slutt vil vi fremføre eksempler fra opprinnelig løsning og løsning med jBPM.",

However, practice has taught us that a lot of teams write few tests, or spend too much time writing and maintaining them. Different development teams make common mistakes, run into similar issues and find their own solutions for them. This costs a lot of valuable time.",
    "description": "Unitils started in 2005, when a group of developers and architects joined in a task force to share their testing experience. These discussions resulted in a set of testing guidelines. The leaders of this task force started writing code to help implementing these guidelines. Unitils has emerged from concrete experience and lessons learned, with the ultimate goal of making unit testing easy, effective and maintainable. Unitils offers a lot of support in testing the database layer: automatic maintenance of test databases, automatic post-processing of the database to make it more test-friendly, loading test data using DbUnit and verifying the contents of the database after execution of a test. Unitils provides specific support for testing with JPA or hibernate, and offers integration with spring. It makes abstraction of the testing framework that is used for executing the tests, making it useable with JUnit3, JUnit4 or TestNG. But Unitils is not limited to persistence layer testing only: The reflection assert utility is a very useful alternative to the classic assertEquals method with a range of leniency options. Unitils also provides superior support for dynamic mock objects, offering a simple syntax for specifying method behavior and verifying expectations. During this talk, I will present the different features of Unitils using simple, concrete examples. I will talk about problems from real projects and demonstrate how Unitils helps solving these problems. * Introduction * Feature overview: Using examples, I’ll demonstrate the features of Unitils: assertion using reflection, test data management, test database maintenance, JPA / hibernate and spring integration, testing with mock objects. * Demo: demonstration of the database maintainer, JPA / hibernate entity-database mapping test * Architecture: Provide some insight into how Unitils works. * Summary and roadmap: What are our plans for the future * Q & A Required experience: Basic experience with unit testing.

    "description": "In the past two years I presented the talks “The Top 10 Ways to Botch an Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application” and “The Top 10 Ways to Botch Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application Scalability and Reliability”. Now that people have plenty of expertise on how to botch their applications, I wanted to shift focus from anti-patterns to patterns. The \"Top 10\" theme remains as it keeps a quick pace and enforces a quick distillation of complex topics into simple concepts for the audience to remember. In this presentation I will use real world examples to demonstrate the challenges, solutions, and unexpected discoveries architects find when building scalable Java applications. I will site actual scenarios where each pattern has been used, and explain what the driving forces were behind these choices. (This talk consciously steers clear of discussing website scaling via content caching, as this is a topic well-covered by many whitepapers, presentations and other conferences. A few examples: For example, working on an ultra-low-latency JavaSpaces-based trading application was one of our first exposures to Recovery-Oriented Computing (ROC) for transaction processing in a production environment. The ROC concept can be used to achieve otherwise impossible results by selectively persisting only critical system state. Prior to this, we had generally steered clear of non-replicated in-memory data. But applying the ROC concept allowed us to achieve an order-of-magnitude latency improvement over what even the most efficient replicated-memory approach would have allowed, without compromising system availability. Likewise, working with a high-volume clearing application, a partner discovered that while serializable database isolation was required from a business perspective, and their database of choice enforced this optimistically, performing initial locking in-memory minimized the number of transaction rollbacks, substantially increasing system throughput. Much of this experience was acquired while working with customers in the usual early-adopter sectors: websites for retail, travel and hospitality; transaction processing and compute grids in investment banks; and more recently, the rush of so-called \"Web 2.0\" startups. While in most of these cases, the primary reason for being onsite with the customer was the Coherence product that I am involved with, many of the more interesting lessons came from working with 3rd party products from dozens of vendors and open source communities, and learning alternate solutions to common problems from the people involved with those products.

Han svarer; \"No, I can only tell you what I know\". Vi som jobber med teknologi er alle meningsprodusenter idet vi lager en slags virkelighet som brukerne må forholde seg til. Vi har derfor på mange måter stor innflytelse i det å konstruere en virkelighet, en sannhet som mange brukere ikke setter spørsmålstegn ved. All teknologi handler mye om klassifikasjon av objekter og relasjoner mellom objekter, kategorier etc. Klassifikasjon vil si å dele inn objekter, personer, dyr eller andre fenomener etter kategorier eller typer. Et klassifikasjonssystem er en type kunnskap og kunnskap vil alltid ha et ideologisk aspekt. Men hvor bevisste er vi dette ansvaret? Gjennom en kort introduksjon av de tidligste sosialantropologiske studier av matklassifikasjon og totempæler vil jeg forsøke å vise at dagens semantiske web på mange måter er i tråd med disse tidligste fagteorienes hovedtanker, som for eksempel det å se det enkelte system som avgrensede enheter, som kan studeres alene. Avleggere fra tidlige forsøk på å se kunnskap i lys av klassifikasjonssystemer skinner i dag gjennom hos flere teoretiske tilnærminger som det til stadighet refereres til og jeg vil argumentere for at det er dags for å trekke inn verktøy koblet mot en metodikk som både er i tråd med tida vi lever i og som løfter blikket fra studier av avgrensende enheter og som retter blikket mer mot brukerens egenartede og unike forståelse av det samme fenomenet. Jeg er opptatt av å formidle tungt stoff på enkle måter – og vil bruke konkrete eksempler for å få publikum med på det som kan kalles en faghistorisk charterreise med konkrete eksempler hele veien for å illustrere poengene. De fleste vil nok sitte igjen med noen aha‐opplevelser samt få ett innblikk i en fagverden man har mye til felles med til tross for at man sjelden kobler fag som teknologi og antropologi sammen.

Kanskje heldigvis, siden dokumentene ofte blir utdaterte over tid og dermed blir både ganske verdiløse og direkte skadelige. Dokumentasjonsarbeid er tradisjonelt både kostnadskrevende og lite lystbetont arbeid. Hvilken type dokumentasjon er den viktigste? Hvordan kan vi gjøre det både enklere, billigere og mer motiverende - og ikke minst, mer anvendelig? Dette foredraget gir noen refleksjoner rundt temaet med konkrete eksempler på hvordan dokumentasjonen kan gjøres mer levende gjennom en wiki integrert med andre utbredte støtteverktøy som Subversion og Maven.

    "level": "intermediate",
    "summary": "Four years after the release of the Portlet 1.0 specification, the new Portlet 2.0 specification introduces many new features that will greatly improve the interactivity of portlet applications and portals. The specification introduces advanced coordination features such as portlet events standardizing inter portlet communication and public render parameters which allows several portlets to share the same render parameters. The new resource serving feature allows a portlet to deliver personalized resources to the browser such as images or PDF documents based on the current user preferences and profile, it also offers the capability to serve markup fragments from a portlet providing support for ajax portlet development. Portlets are now allowed to interact with the portal request and response with the possibility to read or write HTTP headers and insert markup elements to the head section of the portal page. Others important features such as enhanced content caching and portlet filtering have been also introduced in the specification.",
    "description": "* Short introduction (3mns) * Portal & Portlet 1.0 (10mns) ** explain the role of an enterprise portal in the ecosystem and the solution it provides ** portlet history and concepts: brief recap of the Portlet 1.0 specification, its history, limitations and place in the Java EE ecosystem; brief overview of portlet containers * New Portlet 2.0 features focusing on advanced portlet coordination and AJAX applications based on the resource serving feature. Other features are reviewed albeit in lesser detail. Each major feature is explained, introduced by use cases. Differences with Portlet 1.0 are examined when relevant. Features are then demonstrated to get the audience to efficiently understand the concepts. ** Coordination features: portlet events and portlet public render parameters ** AJAX portlets based on the resource serving feature: the resource serving feature and use case for implementing AJAX portlet are explained.

    "level": "intermediate",
    "summary": "Deltakerne på denne sesjonen vil få innsikt i praksiser for effektivt å kommunisere og prioritere krav, estimere kostnader og gjennomføre utviklingsprosjekter. Ettersom dette er temaer uten fasitsvar legges det opp til mye diskusjon og interaksjon. Programvareprosjekter mislykkes ofte med å levere lovede resultater, og kostnadsoverskridelser er en stor og hyppig utfordring. Mangelfull kravhåndtering er ofte en underliggende årsak til disse utfordringene. Det finnes imidlertid en rekke indikasjoner på at gode samarbeidspraksiser kan redusere omfanget på problemet. Det har vært anslått at samarbeid og kommunikasjon utgjør opptil 70% av den totale tidsbruken i programvareprosjekter, og å anbefale en høy andel av samarbeid og kundeinvolvering er derfor ikke noe nytt. Utfordringen er imidlertid å identifisere hva som utgjør et godt samarbeid, og hvordan dette kan oppnås. Mange utviklingsorganisasjoner benytter seg i økende grad av iterative og inkrementelle prosesser, for eksempel Scrum. Imidlertid har også de smidige prosessene, og andre prosesser slik som RUP, mangler når det gjelder å involvere sentrale aktører som kunder, interaksjonseksperter og brukertestere. De iterative og inkrementelle prosessene er unektelig bedre utrustet enn de sekvensielle prosessene (fossefall) når det kommer til å håndtere disse behovene, men de er samtidig også langt mer innstilt på å tilfredsstille behovene til utviklingsteamet. Denne sesjonen skisserer samarbeidspraksiser vi mener øker sjansen for verdiskapning i utviklingsprosjekter. Hovedfokuset er praksiser for å: * Definere en prosess som forbedrer prosjektgjennomføring * Kommunisere og samarbeide om kravhåndtering og forretningsprioritering * Samarbeide om estimering og planlegging Et overordnet prinsipp for diskusjonen vil være å skissere et rammeverk for kravhåndtering som illustreres gjennom en kommunikasjonspyramide. Denne pyramiden skiller mellom fem generiske nivåer for kommunikasjon om krav, som er nyttig i de fleste prosjekter. Disse er: * Forretningsmål * Overordnede krav * Detaljerte krav (f.eks. brukerhistorier) * Utviklingsoppgaver * Kildekode (f.eks. konkrete funksjoner) For hvert nivå presenterer vi en oversikt over hvilke roller som typisk bør være involvert i kommunikasjon og samarbeid. Rollene som diskuteres inkluderer sluttbrukere, kunder, interaksjonsdesignere, utviklere, testere og prosjektledere. Det blir også presentert erfaringer fra et pågående forskning- og utviklingsprosjekt innenfor området.",

    "title": "Better Domain Driven Design",
    "level": "intermediate",
    "summary": "One of the core principles of domain driven design is that it should be focused on the domain and it’s logic, rather than the technology used to implement the system. However, many projects using the domain driven approach get tangled up in the technicalities of software development which increases complexity, reduces velocity and hurts both maintainability and reusability. In this talk I will demonstrate how to employ software engineering principles like \"Don’t Repeat Yourself\" (DRY), the single responsibility principle, separation of concerns and many more to keep attention on the model and at the same time cater for the concerns that clutter the designs of many domain driven solutions. After attending this talk, you should have a better understanding of how to separate your infrastructural con- cerns from your domain logic, build adaptable domain models that fit into many usage scenarios and keep those models maintainable throughout the entire project life-cycle.",
    "description": "* Introduction. This section is just a brief introduction to the ensuing topics. ~2 minutes. * ΄When Patterns Become Anti-patterns‘. This section will show how we unconsciously collapse our ap- plication structures by using design patterns to increase flexibility and let rigidity creep in to our designs. ~5 minutes. * The Strategy Pattern. The Strategy pattern enables us to select algorithms at runtime, but this comes with at the cost of forcing classes to have knowledge about the contexts in which these algorithms are used. Focusing on the implementation of a commonly used pattern drives attention to- wards how we can implement the same pattern with different means, which will be one of the themes for the rest of the talk. * The Collapse of Application Structure. Our implementations of common design patterns causes a ΄pattern lock-in‘ that can fragment domain logic and blur out the distinction between domain and in- frastructure logic. This can hurt the maintainability of our applications. Making Roles Explicit. This section will focus on improving the design of a domain model’s internals to achieve better separation of concerns and improved flexibility and maintainability. ~15 minutes * Our Objects Play Too Many Roles. Our domain objects, especially Aggregates, often violate sound software engineering principles. The upside of this is that it gives developers using these a better experience, the downside is that it hurts maintainability. In this section I will show how the common validation patterns we use in our models violates the single responsibility principle and eschew domain concepts. * Refactoring to Explicit Roles. In this section I will show how to separate the concerns in the previ- ous section into domain objects and services that adhere to the single responsibility principle and makes the solution more extensible. * Data Access is Infrastructure. This section will focus on improving the architecture of an application by clearly distinguishing between domain logic and infrastructure code. Towards the end we connect the dots by combining the lessons from this section with the ones form the previous section. ~20 minutes * Don’t Repeat Yourself! In domain driven design we use Repositories to abstract the data access layer. Different Repositories often share the same behavior and their implementations often violate the DRY principle. In this section I will show how to refactor the repository concepts into an application’s supporting infrastructure to increase productivity, reusability and maintainability without sacrificing the flexibility of hand-rolled repositories. * Lazy About Lazy Loading. Repositories are commonly used in conjunction with object/relational mappers to increase separation of concerns. As the real-world concerns of software development manifest themselves, these abstractions start to leak and soon our domain services get tainted with fetching strategies and similar. In this section I will show how we can combine the concepts from previous sections with Inversion of Control to keep our models clean. * Wrap up. In this section the emphasis is on separation of concerns, the DRY-principle and the importance of keeping roles explicit. ~5 minutes Required experience Attendants should have at least a basic understanding of domain driven design to get full yield. The design principles and techniques presented are generally applicable, and can be of interest to attendants with out experiences with domain driven design. Expected audience This talk is directed towards developers and architects who practice or want to practice domain driven de- sign. It should also be of interest to domain driven design skeptics who feel that this practice bring too much complexity into their designs.",

    "description": "The first step is to have the dynamic language run on the JVM to benefit from the HotSpot investment, the second one is to have the associated web framework take advantage of an application server infrastructure providing pooling, recycling and other monitoring services. With the advent of modular architectures at the heart of modern application servers, it becomes now possible de make the wealth of Java APIs and the benefits of such a runtime available to artifacts beyond J2EE/Java EE. This talk will cover the value of dynamic languages to augment the value of existing applications and how these are implemented on the new, modular, OSGi-based GlassFish v3 architecture. It will discuss the integration of JRuby on Rails, PHP, Groovy/Grails, Python/Django and maybe other dynamic technologies in GlassFish. Demos and a couple success stories included.

    "description": "En vanlig løsning er å spørre serveren med jevne mellomrom ved å bruke Ajax. Slik polling gir dårlig responstid og fører til et unødvendig høyt antall forspørsler. Ved å trikse litt med HTTP kan vi imidlertid holde en forespørsel åpen over lang tid og la serveren sende data når det passer. Denne asynkrone push-arkitekturen kalles gjerne \"Comet\". Dette foredraget forklarer teknologien bak Comet, de nye mulighetene den tilbyr og utfordringene vi får på kjøpet. Foredraget tar utgangspunkt i servletcontaineren Jetty og Javascript-biblioteket Dojo. Sammen gjør disse det svært enkelt å utvikle Comet-baserte applikasjoner. Vi viser hvordan man kommer i gang med Comet og hvordan vi ved hjelp av Jetty og Dojo kan lage en webbasert chatapplikasjon på få minutter. Vi ser på flere eksempler der Comet er i produksjonskode og diskuterer ytelse og skalerbarhet i Jetty sin implementasjon. Vi viser også hvordan Comet støttes i forslaget til den kommende versjon 3.0 av Java Servlets-spesifikasjonen. * Why Comet? ** Increasing need for low latency, \"always current\" services ** Limitations of Polling, Ajax * What is Comet? ** Comet transports, long poll vs. streaming ** Comet is HTTP ** Asynchronuous IO (it's hard) ** Bayeux protocol * Some Comet examples (Screensshots / live demos / screencasts) ** SVNSearch real-time commits ** live.chess.com ** GMail ** Distributed Paint clone implemented with Javascript and Comet. * About Jetty ** Small, fast, testable, embeddable, and enjoyable open source servlet container. * About Dojo ** Javascript toolkit ** DOM manipulation, Effects, Widgets ** Plugin based ** Client side of Bayeux protocol implemented as a Dojo plugin * Chat example with Jetty and Dojo. (probably a mix of live coding and slides) ** Create Maven project ** Add Jetty, Dojo, Comet dependencies ** Add ContinuationCometdServlet to web.xml ** Adding a main method for Jetty with a SelectChannelConnector ** Creating a simple chat application with Dojo * Comet performance and scalability ** Greg's numbers? ** 20.000 concurrent users ** Comparison with polling * Comet limitations ** Container support ** OS/Container tuning (file descriptors, ) ** Firewalls ** Proxying (Apache mod_proxy?) * The future ** Servlet 3.0 ** Bayeux on Tomcat, Glassfish Required experience: Deltakere bør ha kjennskap til web-progammering i Java og ha grunnleggende kunnskap om HTTP.

The ingredients, the recipe, the baking itself, the enjoyment of the cake, the great treat of it to keep in memory and the comfortable feeling afterwards are part of the total value and quality of the tasty cake. With the enjoyment of software is it likewise. The inner quality of software is crucial for your success in software development projects. This talk gives answers why this kind of quality is so important and how to gain better technical quality using different metrics based on the usage of the open source software XRadar (and others).",
    "description": "The quality of software can be divided into two parts. The first part is the outer quality, also known as functional quality. This is the quality seen by the user of the software. The second part is the internal quality, also known as technical quality. This is the quality seen by the software engineers. The testing of software is often only based on functional testing. Because the functional testing is driven by the functional requirements, the functional quality is easy to test and easy to measure. The technical part of the software is almost ignored, because the technical quality is harder to test. But the technical quality directly affects the functional quality. Sometimes you have non-functional requirements like response time for a certain function, but other non-functional requirements, like maintainability, are not measured. The talk will give the attendees ideas how to “test” or measure the technical quality of their software. I will give answers concerning basic questions on software quality, source code, object model, software metrics and their relationship. I will give a short introduction into basic terms and I will give a short overview on basic metrics and metrics on a higher, aggregated level. Then I will show some open source tools like PMD, ckjm, JDepend and will discuss the usage problems. Tools like SonarJ, Sonar and Xradar have more benefits. They consolidate the basic reports of the basic tools to create more readable and understandable reports of your software. The talk will have a focus on practical methods. I will also give examples based on daily project practice and the usage based on the open source tool XRadar (xradar.sourceforge.net).

Jørund Leknes har bl.a stilt flere spørsmål om åpen kildekode og fri programvare i Stortingets spørretime, og han har også ledet IKT-utvalget i SV som skisserte tiltak for å gjøre Norge til en ledende IKT-nasjon. Grunnen til fokuset på IKT, er at han er en av få SV-politikere som behersker dette fagfeltet[trenger referanse]. Han har programmert siden han var 14 år, og behersker bl.a programmeringsspråkene C, Java og C++. Leknes har havnet blant de ti beste i NM i programmering fire ganger."

This version of Spring, the de-facto Java EE application platform marks the beginning of the introduction of alternative ways to configure components. In the, we've mainly focused on provided XML as the main language to perform Dependency Injection on object. Since 2.5, Spring has introduced several new ways to doing this. This session focuses on the various ways of using the Spring container to Dependency Inject objects such as the traditional <beans> XML language, the extensible namespaces, the @Autowired and @Component annotations, but also the innovative JavaConfig project that is capable of configuring Java objects using @Bean annotations. Each has drawbacks and advantages and this session will discuss which one you should choose in what scenario. After this code-intensive session, you will walk away with a clear understanding of when XML is a good choice for configuration and when to opt for one of the annotation-based options.",

Although object orientation is far from being a new approach (think Sergeant Pepper), and it's also far from being obscure, its mainstream adoption by programmers and programming languages alike is not always as effective as it could be, and sometimes the results can be less than desirable (to put it politely). This session aims to put a number of concepts many developers may be unsure of on a firmer footing, highlighting common pitfalls in OO practice -- such as abuse of inheritance, simplistic getter/setter interfaces, patternitis, use of singleton objects -- and emphasising techniques that promote an easier life -- such as loose coupling, unit testability, pattern-based design thinking, incremental and sufficient design.",

    "summary": "Dette er en erfaringsrapport fra MATS-prosjektet hos Mattilsynet, der Computas implementerer og integrerer en kartklient i webklienten og SWING-klienten. Rammebetingelsene for prosjektet var at kartserveren skulle være Java-basert og åpen kilde, slik at det ville være mulig å gjøre tilpasninger dersom det skulle være nødvendig. Videre var bare rene serverløsninger relevant siden klienten kom til å være egenutviklet. Valgmulighetene var derfor veldig begrenset; i praksis kun GeoServer. Selve klienten bruker OpenLayers, et åpen kilde JavaScript-bibliotek som støtter de viktigste protokollene. Det ble vurdert å utvikle en egen kartklient i SWING, men dette ble forkastet på grunn av begrensningene for minneforbruk i kjøremiljøet. Dette førte på sin tur til et behov for å kunne sende kartdata fra web-basert kartklient til SWING-klient, som ble løst ved å la kartklienten gjøre et HTTP-kall til SWING-klienten via en skjult IFRAME. Dermed var det heller ikke lenger nødvendig å bruke WFS-T- protokollen for å kjøre transaksjoner med geodataene direkte mellom klient og server, slik at vi kunne begrense løsningen til WMS. Det er mulig at det senere vil dukke opp krav som gjør det likevel nødvendig å utvide løsningen med støtte for WFS-T, men dette vil ikke være et stort problem siden også WFS-T støttes av GeoServer. Til slutt noen ord om plasseringen av GeoServer i vår arkitektur. I og med at den står ved siden av integrasjonsplattformen og er koblet direkte mot databasen bryter den med alle SOA-prinsipper, men alternativene viste seg å ikke fungere. En mulighet hadde vært å sette GeoServer foran integrasjonsplattformen, men dette hadde ført til økt risiko og mye merarbeid i prosjektet siden GeoServer er bygget opp slik at den forventer direkte tilgang til databasen. Å inkludere GeoServer i integrasjonsplattformen var heller ikke en god løsning da dette hadde ført til ekstra arbeid for å kunne deploye GeoServer i plattformen.",

Vi diskuterer også checked exceptions - et eksperiment i Java - og forklarer hvorfor de bør unngås.",

I dette foredraget vil vi ikke ha noen grunnleggende gjennomgang av smidig prosjektledelse, men heller dykke dypere ned i utvalgte aspekter hvor vi ofte har sett eller begått feil, eller har sett stort forbedringspotensiale. Foredraget vil i stor grad ta utgangspunkt i eksempler fra forskjellige prosjekter vi har vært involvert i de siste årene, og belyse praktiske aspekter som vi har sett folk sliter med. I tillegg vil vi se på en grunn til å kjøre smidig som ofte ikke er godt nok belyst: *Den økonomiske*. Trond har bakgrunn som siviløkonom. Christian har bakgrunn som utvikler. Begge har endt opp som prosjektledere med sterkt fokus på smidig prosjektmetodikk og ledelsesfilosofi. Til sammen har de ca 20 års erfaring fra bransjen, men de gjør fortsatt feil, lærer fortsatt nye ting og ser stadig forbedringspotensialer.",

    "summary": "Quercus is Caucho Technology's 100% Java implementation of PHP. This technology is taking off not only because of the trend toward scripting in the Java community, but also because of the performance and reliability that Java adds to PHP. In this talk, we will present the compelling reasons to use PHP on Java including availability of applications, ease of view development, and performance improvements of upto 89% over PHP with APC. We will show specific use cases of Quercus such as using popular PHP applications like MediaWiki, WordPress, and Drupal directly, bridging existing Java and PHP applications, and using PHP as a view technology for Java. We will also show the unique capabilities of the Quercus implementation such as transparent clustered sessions and use of Java objects natively from PHP. Finally, we will look at case studies of real Quercus deployments such as LiveProcess, the leader in emergency preparedness' planning for the healthcare industry, and others to see how these applications take advantage of PHP on Java.",

    "title": "Hvorfor Læring av Erfaring er Vanskelig og Hvordan Bli Bedre (inklusiv NM i estimering)",
    "level": "intermediate",
    "summary": "Uten læring av egen og andres erfaring er det vanskelig å bli særlig god i programmering, prosjektledelse, estimering, kommunikasjon med kunde og andre viktige gjøremål. Gjennom flere empiriske studier har vi funnet vi at både \"on-the-job\" læring og tradisjonelle prosjektgjennomganger (post-mortem reviews, retrospectives, erfaringsrapportering m.m.) i mange sammenhenger har store svakheter og ofte gir feillæring og overreaksjoner i stedet for økt innsikt og bedre prestasjoner. Ønske om å lære noe fra en smertefull erfaring er for eksempel ofte større enn mulighetene og evnene, og det er derfor også viktig å vite når man ikke bør prøve å lære av erfaring! I denne presentasjonen går vi gjennom en del feilkilder og hvordan disse kan unngås for å forbedre evnen til læring av erfaring i systemutviklings. Avslutningsvis avholdes det 3. norgesmesterskapet i estimering (Tidligere vinnere er: Sindre Mehus og Tore Engvig). Som tidligere vil finalistene i estimerings-NM kunne glede seg over gavekort fra en av byens bedre restauranter.",
    "description": "* En interaktiv oppgave som illustrerer hvor lett man feillærer i en systemutviklingskontekst. * Evidensbaserte anbefalinger for å bli bedre til å lære av erfaring. Presentasjonen vil bygge på flere av våre egne studier om læring og på kjente læringsskjevheter (som å se mønster der ingen finnes, å vektlegge direkte men overse \"systemtiske\" årsaker, forskjell i type årsaksanalyse som gjøres i når man lykkes (\"vi lykkes\"), og mislykkes (\"utenforstående hendelser gjorde slike at vi ...\"), m.m. * Norgesmesterskap i estimerings Required experience: Ingen spesiell. Expected audience: Alle med interesse i bedre læring av erfaring",
